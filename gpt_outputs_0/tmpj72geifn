Here is an example of a navigational XML mission plan based on the provided GeoJSON data:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<MissionPlan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.example.com/mission-plan.xsd
             http://www.example.com/mission-plan.xsd">
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Visit trees in 100m radius and take pictures</TaskDescription>
    <Outcome>
      <DrivingToTree location="[-120.42302289785604, 37.36635688574164]"/>
      <TakePicture treeId="0"/>
      <DrivingToTree location="[-120.42309252722157, 37.36631509745154]"/>
      <TakePicture treeId="1"/>
      <!-- ... -->
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</MissionPlan>
```
Note that I've assumed the following:

* The `DrivingToTree` task will drive to a specific location and stop at the tree.
* The `TakePicture` task will take a picture of the tree at the current location.
* The `treeId` attribute is used to identify each tree, which can be obtained from the GeoJSON data.

Also, I've omitted some trees that are too close together (e.g., trees 10 and 11) as it's not clear whether you want to visit both of them. If you want to visit all trees in the area, you may need to modify the mission plan accordingly.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further modifications!
