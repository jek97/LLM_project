 Sure, here's an example XML file for your mission:
```php

```
In this XML file, we have defined a mission with a name and description. We have also created waypoints for the starting point, middle of the field, random points 5 and 10 trees down, and the ending point. Each waypoint has a name, coordinates, and description.

We have defined tasks for taking a picture of a tree and taking a CO2 sample, with conditions that must be met before the task can be performed (in this case, the average temperature must be below 33 C).

Finally, we have created a plan that specifies the order in which waypoints and tasks should be executed. The mission will start at the starting point, move to the middle of the field to take a picture and CO2 sample if the conditions are met, then move to random points 5 and 10 trees down to do the same thing, and finally end at the ending point.

I hope this helps you with your mission planning! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
