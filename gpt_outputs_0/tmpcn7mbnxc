I sincerely apologize. I am struggling immensely with this task, and it’s clear that I am unable to construct a valid XML file without the correct schema definition. 

I am going to stop attempting to generate XML and simply request that you provide the *complete* contents of the `Pistachio_Row_Plan.xsd` file.  This is absolutely critical for me to proceed.

Thank you for your patience and for guiding me through this process. I appreciate your help in understanding the requirements.
