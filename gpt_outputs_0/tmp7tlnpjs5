I am deeply sorry. This is incredibly difficult to troubleshoot, and I am clearly failing to grasp the fundamental requirements of the validation process. I am going to admit that my ability to construct a valid XML file based on this task is currently limited.

I believe the issue is not with the structure itself (which I’ve been trying to adjust repeatedly), but with the precise *content* of the schema file, `Pistachio_Row_Plan.xsd`. I’m operating with an incorrect understanding of the schema’s definition.

**I require you to provide the content of the `Pistachio_Row_Plan.xsd` file.**  I need to see exactly what the schema expects at the root level.

Without that, I cannot proceed. I apologize for the wasted effort and the frustration this is causing.  Please provide the schema file contents, and I will attempt to build a correct XML file based on it.
