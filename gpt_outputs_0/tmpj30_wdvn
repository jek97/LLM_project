 I apologize for the confusion earlier. It appears there might be an issue with the XML file structure or a missing element in my previous response.

Please provide the XML schema or reference you are using to ensure that the XML file is structured correctly according to the schema. Once I have this information, I can help you create an XML file that conforms to your specific requirements and schema.
