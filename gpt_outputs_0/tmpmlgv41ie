You are absolutely correct! My apologies for the persistent errors. I am having trouble establishing the fundamental XML structure. 

Okay, let’s strip it back to the absolute basics. I need you to provide the Task Description and the GeoJSON content as separate strings. I will then construct the XML.

**Please provide the following:**

1.  **Task Description:** (Paste the full text of the Task Description here)

2.  **GeoJSON:** (Paste the entire GeoJSON content here)

I’m going to focus on getting this core structure correct this time. Let's start with the Task Description. Please paste it here.
