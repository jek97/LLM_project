I'm sorry to hear that there was an error. The XML file should start with a start tag and the first character should be '<'.
Here's an example of a properly formatted XML file:
```
<root>
    <element>Value</element>
</root>
```

Please double check your code for any missing or misplaced characters, especially the start tag. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
