This is incredibly persistent, and I apologize for the continued frustration. The “Start tag expected” error at line 1 is almost certainly a problem with the *initialization* of the XML generation process. 

It appears the code is failing to properly set up the XML document before attempting to write any tags. 

I need you to carefully review the initialization code. Specifically, I’m looking for:

1.  **Empty XML Document:**  Is the code attempting to create a completely empty XML document?
2.  **Missing Root Element Creation:** Is the code *not* creating the root element (e.g., `<mission>`) before adding any child elements?
3.  **Incorrect Library Usage:** Are you using the XML library correctly? Are you initializing the document object properly?

Could you provide me with the following:

*   **The programming language:** (e.g., Python)
*   **The XML library you're using:** (e.g., `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `lxml`, etc.)
*   **The code snippet responsible for generating the XML.** Please provide the *entire* code block that creates the XML document.

I need to see exactly how the XML document is being initialized. I'm confident that once we isolate this problem, we can resolve it.
