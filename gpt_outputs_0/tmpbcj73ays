 Here is an example of an XML mission plan based on your requirements:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <name>Pistachio Tree Visiting Mission</name>
    <description>Visit 5 pistachio trees in a row and take pictures of 3 of them.</description>
    <tasks>
        <task id="1">
            <name>Move to the first pistachio tree</name>
            <action>Drive to the first pistachio tree location</action>
        </task>
        <task id="2">
            <name>Take a picture of the first pistachio tree</name>
            <action>Use the camera to take a picture of the first pistachio tree</action>
        </task>
        <task id="3">
            <name>Move to the second pistachio tree</name>
            <action>Drive to the second pistachio tree location</action>
        </task>
        <task id="4">
            <name>Take a picture of the second pistachio tree</name>
            <action>Use the camera to take a picture of the second pistachio tree</action>
        </task>
        <task id="5">
            <name>Move to the third pistachio tree</name>
            <action>Drive to the third pistachio tree location</action>
        </task>
        <task id="6">
            <name>Take a picture of the third pistachio tree</name>
            <action>Use the camera to take a picture of the third pistachio tree</action>
        </task>
        <task id="7">
            <name>Move to the fourth pistachio tree</name>
            <action>Drive to the fourth pistachio tree location</action>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</mission>
```
In this example, the mission plan includes 7 tasks. The first task is to move from the farm to the first pistachio tree. The next three tasks involve taking pictures of each tree in turn. Finally, the last two tasks involve moving to and taking pictures of the remaining two trees. Note that you may need to modify the `<action>` elements to match the specific actions required by your robot.
