 Here is an example of an XML mission plan that conforms to the known schema, using the GeoJSON file provided for task location references:
```php
<mission>
    <title>Picture and CO2 Readings</title>
    <tasks>
        <task id="1" type="Take Picture">
            <target>[12.345, 678.90]</target>
        </task>
        <task id="2" type="Take CO2 Reading">
            <target>[23.678, 456.123]</target>
        </task>
        <task id="3" type="Take Picture">
            <target>[23.678, 456.123]</target>
        </task>
        <task id="4" type="Take CO2 Reading">
            <target>[23.679, 456.124]</target>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</mission>
```
Please note that this is just an example and the tasks, their sequence, and the target coordinates can be adjusted to fit your specific requirements.
