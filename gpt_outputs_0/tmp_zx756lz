Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who's encountering an XML validation error in their mission planning XML file. The error message says there's "extra content at the end of the document" on line 13, column 1 with the element name `tmpa6efs2vz`. 

First off, it seems like they might have a typo or an undefined custom tag somewhere in their XML file that's causing the validation issue. The error message suggests there's extra content beyond what is expected by the schema.

I should consider possible reasons for this error:

1. **Undefined Custom Tag**: They might have a custom element name (e.g., `tmpa6efs2vz`) that isn't properly defined or declared in their XML file.
   
2. **Extra Characters or Data**: There could be extra characters, data, or content at the end of the document that doesn't conform to the expected schema.

3. **Whitespace Issues**: Sometimes, extra whitespace or comments at the end of the file can cause validation errors.

To resolve this issue:

1. **Check for Custom Tags**: If `tmpa6efs2vz` is a custom tag, ensure it's properly defined with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration or within a DTD if they're using one.

2. **Validate XML Structure**: Ensure that all elements are properly closed and nested. Extra tags or content at the end of the file can cause validation issues.

3. **Inspect the End of the File**: Look for any extra characters, comments, or data beyond line 13, column 1. This could include trailing whitespace, comments, or unexpected data.

4. **Use XML Validation Tools**: Tools like `xml validators` or schema validators can help identify where the validation is failing. They can pinpoint if it's a custom tag, extra content, or other issues.

5. **Review GeoJSON References**: Since you're using GeoJSON references in your mission plan, ensure that all referenced elements are correctly formatted and within the expected structure.

If `tmpa6efs2vz` isn't part of their intended XML structure, replacing it with a standard element name like `Tree` or `Location` would make sense if that's what they're trying to represent. Also, ensuring that all tags are properly closed and nested will help prevent similar issues in the future.

If you can provide more details about the specific XML file or the exact content causing the issue, I can offer a more tailored solution.

It seems there might be an issue with your XML file structure or content. The error message indicates that there is "extra content at the end of the document" on line 13, column 1 in your mission plan XML file. This suggests that either:

1. There is a typo or undefined custom tag (e.g., `tmpa6efs2vz`) present in your XML file.
2. There are extra characters, comments, or data beyond what is expected by the schema.
