It seems that I made an incorrect assumption again.

Let's try a different approach. Here is the corrected version of the XML file:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<missionPlan>
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Drive to the middle of the field and take a picture of a tree.</TaskDescription>
    <DrivingLocation>
      <GPSLocation>
        <latitude>37.36635688574164</latitude>
        <longitude>-120.42302289785604</longitude>
      </GPSLocation>
    </DrivingLocation>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>

  <Outcome>
    <DrivingDistance>0 km</DrivingDistance>
    <ActionDescription>Take a picture of a tree.</ActionDescription>
    <Condition>
      <TemperatureThreshold>33 C</TemperatureThreshold>
    </Condition>
    <AdditionalActions>
      <TakeCO2Sample/>
    </AdditionalActions>
  </Outcome>

  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Drive to another random point 5 trees down and take a picture of a tree.</TaskDescription>
    <DrivingLocation>
      <GPSLocation>
        <latitude>37.36631509745154</latitude>
        <longitude>-120.42309252722157</longitude>
      </GPSLocation>
    </DrivingLocation>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>

  <Outcome>
    <DrivingDistance>0 km</DrivingDistance>
    <ActionDescription>Take a picture of a tree.</ActionDescription>
    <Condition>
      <TemperatureThreshold>33 C</TemperatureThreshold>
    </Condition>
    <AdditionalActions>
      <TakeCO2Sample/>
    </AdditionalActions>
  </Outcome>

  <!-- Randomly select another point 5 trees down -->
  <RandomPointSelection>
    <TreeID>6</TreeID>
  </RandomPointSelection>
</missionPlan>
```
I removed the `xmlns` and `xsi:schemaLocation` attributes, as they are not necessary for this XML file.

However, I noticed that you're trying to write XML code in a text editor. It's recommended to use an XML editor or a tool like Notepad++ with the XML mode enabled to write and edit XML files.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your environment and the exact error message you're seeing.

Alternatively, I can suggest using an online XML editor or a code generator tool to create the XML file. Please let me know if that's something you'd be interested in trying.
