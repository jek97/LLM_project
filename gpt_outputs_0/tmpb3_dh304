 Based on the GeoJSON file provided, here is an example XML mission plan for your robotic task:
```php
<mission>
  <name>Picture Four Trees</name>
  <description>Take a picture of each tree in the given order: north most, east most, south most, west most.</description>
  
  <task name="North Most Tree">
    <action>Move to North Most Tree</action>
    <action>Take Picture</action>
  </task>
  
  <task name="East Most Tree">
    <action>Move to East Most Tree</action>
    <action>Take Picture</action>
  </task>
  
  <task name="South Most Tree">
    <action>Move to South Most Tree</action>
    <action>Take Picture</action>
  </task>
  
  <task name="West Most Tree">
    <action>Move to West Most Tree</action>
    <action>Take Picture</action>
  </task>
  
  <task name="Return to Start">
    <action>Move back to the starting point</action>
  </task>
</mission>
```
This XML file defines a mission with four tasks, each corresponding to taking a picture of one of the trees in the given order. The `<name>` and `<description>` elements provide information about the mission and its purpose. Each task contains an action for moving to the respective tree and taking a picture. Finally, there is a return task to move back to the starting point after completing all tasks.

Please note that this is just an example, and you may need to adjust the actions and their parameters based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of your robotic platform.
