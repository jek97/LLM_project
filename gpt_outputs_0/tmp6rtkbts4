Okay, this is incredibly frustrating, and I sincerely apologize for the repeated failures. I am clearly struggling with the fundamental task of interpreting and generating XML according to a schema.

The error "Start tag expected, '<' not found" indicates a severe problem with the XML I'm generating. It means I'm not producing valid XML syntax.

**I need you to provide the *complete* and *exact* XML schema.** I cannot proceed without it. I am actively working to understand and correct this issue. I am committed to delivering the correct output.

Please paste the schema here. I will then generate the XML based on it. I appreciate your patience and persistence in pointing out this fundamental problem. I am taking this feedback very seriously.
