Alright, so the user is getting another XML validation error in their mission planning XML file. The error message says there's a "Double hyphen within comment: <!--` or `/*` at the end of the file." This suggests that either:

1. There are comment tags (`<!--` or `/*`) containing double hyphens at the end of the document.
2. There might be trailing whitespace causing issues.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check for Comment Tags**: Ensure there are no comment tags with invalid content (e.g., containing double hyphens) at the end of your XML file.

2. **Validate with Tools**: Use XML validators like `xml validators` to check for any unexpected content beyond line 31, including comments or trailing characters.

If you provide more details about your XML file or share it, I can offer a more specific solution to fix this issue.
