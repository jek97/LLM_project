It seems like the XML file is still not well-formed.

To generate a valid XML file, I need to know more about the schema and the specific elements that are required. Can you please provide me with the following information:

* The GeoJSON file containing the location data (e.g., latitude, longitude)
* The type of tree being referenced in the mission plan
* Any other specific requirements or constraints for the XML structure

I will use this information to generate a valid XML file that conforms to the schema and meets your requirements.

Here's an example of what the corrected XML file might look like:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<MissionPlan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://robust-mission-planning.org/mission-plan.xsd
             http://robust-mission-planning.org/mission-plan.xsd">
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription xml:lang="en">Take picture of first tree</TaskDescription>
    <DrivingTo>0.00 km</DrivingTo>
    <Outcome>
      <Action xml:lang="en">TakePicture</Action>
      <LocationRef featureId="0">
        <GeoJSONFeature>
          <geometry type="Point">
            <coordinates>-122.084051 47.620261</coordinates>
          </geometry>
          <properties>
            <treeType>Quaking Aspen</treeType>
          </properties>
        </GeoJSONFeature>
      </LocationRef>
      <EstimatedHaversineDistanceFromStart>0.00 km</EstimatedHaversineDistanceFromStart>
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
  <!-- Add more CompositeTaskInformation elements as needed -->
</MissionPlan>
```
Please let me know if this is close to what you're looking for, or if I need to make further adjustments.

Note: The GeoJSON data should be in the format of:
```
{
  "type": "Point",
  "coordinates": [-122.084051, 47.620261]
}
```
You can replace the coordinates with your actual location data.
