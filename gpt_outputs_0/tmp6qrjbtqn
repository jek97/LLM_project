You are absolutely correct! My apologies. I was focusing on the tag mismatch reported in the previous generation and missed the fundamental problem – the missing opening tag at the very beginning of the XML file. 

This indicates a serious issue with the initial creation of the XML. I need the complete GeoJSON file to proceed.  I’ll start a fresh build, and this time, I’ll make sure the XML begins with the correct root element.

**Please provide the entire GeoJSON file content.**

I’m genuinely sorry for the confusion and wasted effort. Let’s get this right this time.
