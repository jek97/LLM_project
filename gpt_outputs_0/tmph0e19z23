Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what went wrong with the XML mission plan that was generated. The user mentioned an error about extra content at the end of the document on line 81. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that when generating XML files, especially ones that are supposed to be valid and conform to a specific schema, it's crucial to ensure there are no trailing characters or unexpected data at the end. The error message points to line 81, column 1, which is where the extra content is found. That suggests something is wrong around that area of the file.

I remember that XML files should start with "<!" and end with "!", otherwise they're considered invalid. So maybe there's an unexpected character or a leftover string at the end of the file after line 81. The user mentioned using a GeoJSON file for references, so perhaps during the generation process, some extra data was appended mistakenly.

I should check if the XML parser is correctly handling the entire document. Sometimes, editors might accidentally add trailing whitespace or comments that aren't part of the schema. Maybe there's an open tag at the end or something similar. Also, I need to ensure that all elements are properly closed without any leftover attributes or text.

Another possibility is that when concatenating multiple parts of the mission plan, like tasks and GeoJSON data, there was a mistake in how they were joined. Perhaps an extra character or string got appended at the end, causing the parser to flag it as invalid content.

I should also consider if the schema allows for any trailing whitespace or comments. If the schema does, then maybe those are okay, but usually, valid XML shouldn't have anything after the root element ends.

To fix this, I'll need to carefully review the entire XML file from start to finish, looking for any unexpected characters or extra content beyond what's allowed by the schema. Trimming any trailing whitespace and ensuring all tags are properly closed should resolve the issue. Additionally, verifying that the concatenation of tasks and GeoJSON data doesn't introduce any unintended strings is important.

In summary, the error is likely due to invalid XML content at the end of the file, possibly from improper concatenation or leftover characters during generation. By carefully reviewing and cleaning up the XML structure, this issue should be resolved.

The error you encountered ("Extra content at the end of the document") suggests that there's unexpected data present in your XML mission plan after line 81. Here's a step-by-step explanation to resolve this issue:

1. **Check for Trailing Characters**: Ensure that the XML file does not contain any trailing whitespace, comments, or unexpected characters beyond what is allowed by your schema.

2. **Validate the XML Document**: Use an XML validator to check the entire document from start to finish. This will help identify if there are any leftover tags or strings at the end of the file.

3. **Inspect Line 81**: Focus on line 81 and column 1, as this is where the extra content is located. Look for any unexpected characters or data that might have been appended incorrectly during the generation process.

4. **Review Concatenation Processes**: If you're combining multiple parts (like tasks from a JSON file and GeoJSON data), ensure there are no leftover strings or tags being appended at the end of the XML file.

5. **Trim Whitespace**: Remove any trailing whitespace that might have been inadvertently added during processing.

6. **Close Tags Properly**: Ensure all XML elements are properly closed without any open tags remaining, which can cause parsing issues.

By addressing these points, you should be able to identify and remove the extra content causing the error, resulting in a valid XML mission plan.
