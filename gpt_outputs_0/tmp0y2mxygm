I apologize for that mistake. Here's a revised version of the XML mission plan:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Visit as many trees as possible in a 100-meter radius and take pictures</TaskDescription>
    <TaskList>
      <Drive>
        <Location>-120.423000, 37.366300</Location>
      </Drive>
      <TakePicture>
        <Location>-120.423000, 37.366300</Location>
      </TakePicture>
      <Drive>
        <Location>-120.423050, 37.366350</Location>
      </Drive>
      <TakePicture>
        <Location>-120.423050, 37.366350</Location>
      </TakePicture>
      <!-- Add more tasks as needed -->
    </TaskList>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</mission>
```

In this revised version, I've added opening tags for the `<Drive>` and `<TakePicture>` elements that were missing in the previous version. This should fix the error you encountered.
As before, you can modify the locations and number of tasks as needed to meet your specific requirements.
