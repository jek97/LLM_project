 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected XML file:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
  <task name="Take a picture of the first tree">
    <step name="Drive to the first tree"/>
    <step name="Take a picture of the first tree"/>
  </task>
  <task name="Measure the CO2 level in the first tree">
    <step name="Drive to the first tree"/>
    <step name="Check the CO2 reading in the first tree"/>
    <if condition="CO2 reading is low">
      <step name="Take a CO2 sample"/>
      <step name="Confirm the CO2 reading by taking another CO2 sample"/>
    </if>
  </task>
  <task name="Measure another tree, a different one">
    <step name="Drive to the second tree"/>
    <step name="Take a picture of the second tree"/>
    <if condition="CO2 reading is low">
      <step name="Take a CO2 sample"/>
      <if condition="Confirmation CO2 reading is low">
        <step name="Continue driving to another tree and take another CO2 sample"/>
      </if>
    </if>
  </task>
  <end/>
</mission>
```
In this corrected XML file, I added the `<step>` elements for driving to the trees. Additionally, I fixed the indentation of the XML file to ensure it is well-formed and conformant to the schema. The total estimated haversine distance traveled from start to end can be computed by summing the distances between each tree and the end point, but this information should not be included in the XML file itself.
