Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what's going on with this XML mission plan. The user mentioned that there's an error saying "Extra content at the end of the document" on line 21, column 1. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First off, XML files are all about structure—elements and attributes. If there's extra content at the end, it probably means something is left hanging or not properly closed before the file ends. So, maybe an element wasn't closed correctly somewhere in the document.

Looking at line 21, column 1, that's right after the start tag of the XML document. The error message says "tmpn2y2i2va" which I assume is a placeholder for some actual content or attribute name. But since it's at the beginning, maybe there's an extra element declared before any other elements are properly opened.

I should check if all the opening tags have corresponding closing tags and in the correct order. Sometimes, you might declare an element that doesn't get used later, which would leave it open at the end of the file. That could cause this kind of error because the parser expects everything to be properly closed before the document ends.

Another possibility is that there's some trailing data or content after the last closing tag on line 21. Maybe an extra attribute or a leftover string wasn't removed, causing it to appear at the end of the file unexpectedly.

I also need to consider if any tags were duplicated or nested incorrectly. Sometimes, having multiple elements declared without their corresponding opening and closing tags can lead to unexpected content at the end of the file.

To fix this, I'll start by reviewing the entire XML document from line 1 onwards to ensure that every opening tag has a matching closing tag in the correct order. Then, I'll check for any trailing data or extra attributes after the last element is properly closed.

If everything seems structured correctly and there's still an issue, it might be helpful to look at the specific content around line 21 to see if there's something unusual like an unclosed tag or leftover text that shouldn't be there. Ensuring consistency in indentation and proper formatting can also help catch any hidden issues that might not be immediately obvious.

In summary, the error is likely due to improper XML structure—either missing closing tags or trailing content at the end of the document. By carefully reviewing the entire file for these issues, I should be able to resolve the "Extra content" error.

The error message you received indicates that there's extra content at the end of your XML mission plan file, specifically on line 21, column 1. This suggests that either an element was not properly closed or there is trailing data that shouldn't be present.

Here’s a step-by-step explanation to resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Check for Proper Closing Tags
1. **Review the XML Document**: Start by examining the entire XML file from line 1 onwards.
2. **Look for Missing Closures**: Ensure that every opening tag (`<tag>`) has a corresponding closing tag (`</tag>`).
3. **Check Order of Elements**: Verify that all elements are declared in the correct order and that no tags were duplicated or nested incorrectly.

### Step 2: Inspect Line 21
1. **Focus on Line 21, Column 1**: The error message mentions "tmpn2y2i2va" at this position.
2. **Check for Extra Content**: Look for any trailing data or extra attributes that might be left after the last element is closed.

### Step 3: Validate the Document
1. **Use an XML Validator**: Tools like `xml validators` can help identify structural issues in your XML file, such as missing tags or improper nesting.
2. **Check for Trailing Characters**: Ensure there are no extra characters or strings left at the end of the document.

### Step 4: Correct the Issues
1. **Close All Tags Properly**: If you find any unclosed tags, add their corresponding closing tags to ensure all elements are properly nested and closed.
2. **Remove Trailing Data**: If there is any trailing content or data after the last element, remove it so that nothing appears at the end of the file.

### Step 5: Re-Validate
1. **Run the XML Validator Again**: After making changes, validate the document again to ensure all structural issues have been resolved.
2. **Check for Consistency**: Ensure that your XML file follows consistent indentation and formatting rules.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "Extra content" error in your XML mission plan. If the issue persists after reviewing and correcting the obvious problems, consider sharing the specific content around line 21 for further assistance.
