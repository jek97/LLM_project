You are absolutely correct! My apologies. I was focusing on tag mismatches when the fundamental problem was a missing opening tag.  Thank you for pointing out this critical error.

This means the XML document started without the root element (e.g., `<MissionPlan>`).

**I need the complete XML file content to proceed.**  I cannot generate a valid XML plan without it.  Please provide the entire XML file.  I will now address this initial problem and continue to build the mission plan.
