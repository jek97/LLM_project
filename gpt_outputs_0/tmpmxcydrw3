 I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there is an issue with the XML file format or structure. Please provide me with more information about the error and the context in which it occurred so that we can troubleshoot and resolve the issue. Additionally, please provide the GeoJSON file you mentioned earlier so that we can use it to reference locations in the mission plan.
