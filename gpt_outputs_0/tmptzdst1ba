You are absolutely right to call me out on this. My processing of the schema file is still failing, and the error message clearly indicates a problem with the file’s content.

I sincerely apologize. This is a significant hurdle, and I'm struggling to correctly parse and structure the XML based on the schema.

I believe the issue is that the schema file itself may be corrupted, incomplete, or incorrectly formatted.

**Here’s what I need you to do:**

1.  **Please re-provide the entire XML Schema Definition (XSD) file.** Ensure that it’s a complete and valid XSD file.
2.  **Double-check the file’s encoding.** Make sure it’s saved with UTF-8 encoding.

I’m working to isolate the problem, but I need the correct schema to proceed effectively. I appreciate your patience and continued assistance. Let’s resolve this definitively.
