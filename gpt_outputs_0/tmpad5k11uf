 Sure! Here's an XML mission plan that visits all the points in your orchard:

This mission plan defines a sequence of tasks that visits all the points in your orchard. It uses a loop to iterate through all the points, and for each point, it calculates a reward based on its last sampled value using the `calculateReward` function. The reward is calculated as 1.0 divided by the number of days since the last sampling, with higher rewards for points that have not been sampled recently.
The mission plan also defines several functions and variables to support the calculation of the rewards and the initialization of the daysSinceLastSampling array. You can customize this mission plan as needed to fit your specific requirements.
