 I apologize for the confusion. Here is an updated example with a correct start tag and properly formatted XML:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <robot>
        <position x="0" y="0" heading="0"/>
        <capability name="photography"/>
    </robot>
    <distance_threshold value="100"/>
    <movementStrategy type="sequential">
        <!-- ... your movement strategy -->
    </movementStrategy>
    <target id="1">[120.42298051393493, 37.36628908556382]</target>
    <target id="2">[120.42299259529793, 37.36635678715399]</target>
    <!-- ... more targets -->
    <CompositeTaskInformation>
        <TaskDescription>Visit as many trees as possible within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</TaskDescription>
    </CompositeTaskInformation>
</mission>
```
In this example, the XML file starts with a declaration of the XML version and encoding. The mission contains the robot's position and capability information, distance threshold for sequential target visits, movement strategy settings (you can customize the strategy based on your needs), and a list of targets to visit. A `<CompositeTaskInformation>` element is used to include your mission description.

The XML file should now be well-formed without any errors.
