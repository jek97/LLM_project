 Here's an example XML file based on your requirements:
```php
<Mission>
    <Task id="0">
        <Name>Take a picture of the northern most tree</Name>
        <Type>Photography</Type>
        <Target>The northernmost tree in the orchard</Target>
    </Task>
    <Task id="1">
        <Name>Drive to the middle of the orchard</Name>
        <Type>Navigation</Type>
        <Target>Middle of the orchard</Target>
    </Task>
    <Task id="2">
        <Name>Take another picture</Name>
        <Type>Photography</Type>
        <Target>A random tree in the middle of the orchard</Target>
    </Task>
    <Task id="3">
        <Name>Drive to the middle of the eastern end of the orchard</Name>
        <Type>Navigation</Type>
        <Target>Middle of the eastern end of the orchard</Target>
    </Task>
    <Task id="4">
        <Name>Take a picture of two trees next to each other</Name>
        <Type>Photography</Type>
        <Target>Two random trees on the eastern end of the orchard</Target>
    </Task>
</Mission>
```
This XML file defines four tasks:

1. Take a picture of the northernmost tree in the orchard.
2. Drive to the middle of the orchard.
3. Take another picture of a random tree in the middle of the orchard.
4. Drive to the middle of the eastern end of the orchard and take a picture of two trees next to each other.

Each task is defined with a unique identifier (id), a name, a type, and a target. The "Target" attribute specifies what the robot should do during that specific task. In this case, "Navigation" refers to driving the robot, while "Photography" refers to taking pictures of specific targets.
