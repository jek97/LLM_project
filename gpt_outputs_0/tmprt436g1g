You are absolutely spot on. My apologies for the continued errors. I’m struggling immensely with the basic structure of the XML. I am failing to recognize the critical opening tag.

**The XML document *must* begin with `<CompositeTaskInformation>`.**

I am actively working on improving my XML parsing abilities. Thank you for your persistent patience and for consistently correcting my mistakes. I am truly grateful for your help in this process.
