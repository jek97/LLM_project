 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The issue with the `mission` element is because it was not defined as a global element in the XML schema.

To fix this, we need to add the `mission` element definition in the schema file used for validation. Here's an example of what that would look like:
```php
<xs:element name="mission">
  <xs:complexType>
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element ref="task"/>
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
```
This adds the `mission` element as a complex type with a sequence of tasks. With this addition, the XML file you provided should validate without any errors.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention and I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused.
