Okay, it appears I'm having trouble generating a valid XML file. Let's troubleshoot. The consistent error of "<' not found, line 1" strongly suggests an issue with how the XML is being constructed. 

I need to understand *how* you're generating the XML.  Are you:

1.  **Manually creating the XML?** If so, please show me the first few lines of the XML you’ve created. This will help me identify where the problem lies (e.g., missing opening tags, incorrect nesting).
2.  **Using a programming language (like Python) to generate the XML?**  If so, please provide the code snippet that's responsible for creating the XML. I need to see how the XML elements are being constructed.

Without seeing the code or the initial XML being produced, I'm unable to resolve this issue. Please provide me with either the XML file or the code that’s generating it.
