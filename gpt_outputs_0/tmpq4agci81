Alright, let's break this down step by step.

The user is encountering an XML validation error stating that there's no matching global declaration for the root element `CompositeTaskInformation`. This typically means that either:

1. The XML file does not include a declaration of the root element in its header section (e.g., `<!DOCTYPE composite-task-information>`) or
2. The declared namespace is not properly defined.

Given the error occurs on line 2, it's likely that the DOCTYPE declaration for `CompositeTaskInformation` is missing or incorrect.

To fix this:

1. Ensure your XML file starts with a valid DOCTYPE declaration specifying the root element and appropriate namespace.
2. Verify that the namespace declarations match those expected by your mission planning system.
3. Make sure all elements are properly closed within their respective tags.

If you can share your XML file, I can help verify and correct these issues to resolve the validation error.
