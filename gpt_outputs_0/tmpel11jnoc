 I apologize for the error in my previous response. It seems that there was a typo in the XML file. Here is the corrected version of the XML mission plan:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <name>Temperature and CO2 Sampling Mission</name>
    <description>A mission to collect temperature and CO2 readings from trees in the orchard.</description>
    <steps>
        <step id="1">
            <action>Take a picture of the tree</action>
            <condition>If the picture shows low temperature</condition>
            <next>
                <action>Take a temperature reading</action>
                <condition>If the reading is also low</condition>
                <next>
                    <action>Take a CO2 sample</action>
                    <condition>If the reading is also low</condition>
                    <next>
                        <action>Drive to a far away tree and repeat the process</action>
                    </next>
                </next>
            </next>
        </step>
        <step id="2">
            <action>Drive to end</action>
        </step>
    </steps>
</mission>
```
This XML file should now be valid and should not produce any errors. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
