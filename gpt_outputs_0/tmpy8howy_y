 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected XML file with the missing `<mission>` start tag:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <name>Tree Picture Mission</name>
    <description>Visit as many points as possible within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</description>
    <start>
        <point id="1">
            <coordinates>-120.42307592599273,37.36636077337479</coordinates>
        </point>
    </start>
    <tasks>
        <task id="1">
            <type>Take Picture</type>
            <target>Tree</target>
            <distance>100</distance>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</mission>
```
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
