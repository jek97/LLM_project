Sure! Here's an example XML mission plan that visits as many points as possible within a 100-meter radius and takes pictures of each tree:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Visit as many trees as possible in a 100-meter radius and take pictures</TaskDescription>
    <TaskList>
      <Task>
        <Type>Drive</Type>
        <Location>-120.423000, 37.366300</Location>
      </Task>
      <Task>
        <Type>TakePicture</Type>
        <Location>-120.423000, 37.366300</Location>
      </Task>
      <Task>
        <Type>Drive</Type>
        <Location>-120.423050, 37.366350</Location>
      </Task>
      <Task>
        <Type>TakePicture</Type>
        <Location>-120.423050, 37.366350</Location>
      </Task>
      <!-- Add more tasks as needed -->
    </TaskList>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</mission>
```

In this example, the mission starts by driving to the first point and taking a picture of the tree there. Then it drives to another point within a 100-meter radius and takes a picture. This process is repeated until all points have been visited.
You can modify the locations and number of tasks as needed to meet your specific requirements.
