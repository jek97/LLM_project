You are absolutely correct! My apologies – I'm still struggling with the initial XML construction. The error "Start tag expected, '<' not found" means I was generating invalid XML. I was omitting the crucial opening `<` character for the root element.

I am now focusing on generating a *correct* XML document from the start.

**Please provide me with the following:**

1.  **Task Description:** The complete text of the task description.
2.  **GeoJSON File:** The content of the GeoJSON file.

I will now generate the XML mission plan, ensuring the very first character is `<MissionPlan>`.  I sincerely apologize for the repeated errors – I am still under development and learning to build XML consistently. Let’s get this right this time!
