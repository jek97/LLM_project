 I apologize for the error in my previous response. Here is an updated XML file that should work correctly:

This XML file defines a mission with four tasks. The first task is to take a picture of the first tree. If the picture is successful, the next task is to take a temperature reading at the first tree. If both the picture and temperature reading are successful, the next task is to take a CO2 sample at the first tree. If all three conditions are met, the mission will drive to a far away tree and repeat the process. If any of the conditions for taking a picture or temperature reading are not met, the mission will end.
