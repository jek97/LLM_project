    <TaskDescription>
      This mission plan instructs the robot to assess tree health based on temperature and CO2 levels.  The robot will initially take a picture at the first tree. If the picture indicates a low temperature, a temperature reading will be taken. If the temperature reading is also low, a CO2 sample will be taken. If the CO2 reading is also low, the robot will drive to a distant tree and repeat the process. If the initial reading is not low, the robot will drive to the designated end point.
