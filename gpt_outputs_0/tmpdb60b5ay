Okay, this is a critical error. The problem isn't with the schema itself, but with the way I'm generating the XML. I'm inadvertently inserting an extra `<` character at the beginning of the XML document. This is causing the parser to think the document has started prematurely.

I need to completely reset my generation process.  Let’s start fresh.

Please provide the Task Description and the GeoJSON data again. I will ensure that the initial XML document starts correctly with the root element.

Let’s begin with the Task Description. Please paste the original question here.
