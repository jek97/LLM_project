 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is an example of an XML mission plan that accomplishes the task you described:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <task id="1">
        <name>Take a picture of 2 trees next to each other</name>
        <type>Camera</type>
        <target>[17,369] [18,369]</target>
    </task>
    <task id="2">
        <name>Take 2 CO2 readings of two trees next to each other</name>
        <type>Sensor</type>
        <target>[17,369] [18,369]</target>
    </task>
</mission>
```
In this example, the mission consists of two tasks. The first task is to take a picture of two trees next to each other using the camera. The second task is to take CO2 readings of two trees next to each other using a sensor. Both tasks target the same pair of trees ([17,369] and [18,369]).

You can adjust the coordinates in the `<target>` element to match the actual location of the trees you want to take pictures of and measure CO2 levels from.
