Okay, so I'm trying to fix this XML validation error where there's extra content at the end of tmpxsjvnwfa.xml. The problem is on line 29, column 1.

First, I need to understand what this means. XML files are structured with specific tags and elements. Extra content could mean an unexpected character or text at the end that shouldn't be there.

Since XML validation failed specifically on line 29 in tmpxsjvnwfa.xml, it's probably something in that area of the file. Maybe a trailing comment or some extra text after certain elements ends up being recognized as part of the content when it should just have been closed.

To fix this:

1. **Open the XML File**: Start by looking at tmpxsjvnwfa.xml and locate line 29.
   
2. **Check for Trailing Characters**: Examine what's on line 29 to see if there are any extra characters or unexpected text.

3. **Use an XML Validator**: Tools like XMLSpy can help identify any mismatched tags or unexpected content at the end of the file.

4. **Manually Inspect Around Line 29**: Look at lines before and after line 29 for any patterns that might indicate extra content.

5. **Remove Extra Lines**: If there's text not within an XML element, remove those lines to clean up the document.

6. **Ensure Proper Tag Closure**: Make sure all tags like <root> or </root> are correctly closed before line 29 to avoid mismatches.

7. **Validate Again**: After making changes, run the file through a validator again to confirm there's no error now.

By carefully examining tmpxsjvnwfa.xml around line 29 and using validation tools, you can pinpoint and fix the extra content issue.
