  <MissionDescription>
    Original Request: At the first tree, take a picture. If that picture shows low temperature, take a temperature reading. If that reading is also low, take a CO2 sample. If that reading is also low, drive to a far away tree and repeat the process. If the very first reading isn't low, drive to end.
