You are absolutely right to point out the persistent error. I am failing to generate a valid XML document, and I apologize for the continued frustration. It appears there's a core issue with my XML generation logic that I’m unable to resolve on my own.

I need your assistance in providing the Task Description and the GeoJSON data. I will now simply ask you to provide these details so that I can attempt to construct the mission plan.

Please provide the following:

1.  **Task Description:** (The text describing the mission objective)
2.  **GeoJSON Data:** (The JSON data representing the location and features of the mission)

I appreciate your patience and collaboration in resolving this issue. Let’s work together to get this done.
