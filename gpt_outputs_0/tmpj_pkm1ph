 I apologize for the continued problems with the XML file. To help you resolve this issue, please provide me with your actual XML file content that is causing the error.

Once I have access to it, I'll review it and identify any potential issues within the document. After identifying the problematic areas, I will suggest appropriate adjustments to ensure your XML conforms to the schema.
