It seems that the issue is still present.

Let's try a different approach. Since you mentioned that I should use GeoJSON to provide references in the mission plan for things such as GPS location, tree type, etc., I'll create a simple XML file with the required structure and add some sample data:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<RobotMission>
  <TaskDescription>Drive to first tree and inspect</TaskDescription>
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <!-- Driving to first tree -->
    <DrivingToTree id="1">
      <Coordinates>
        <geo:Point xmlns:geo="http://www.w3.org/2003/07 GeoJSON">
          <geo:x>-120.42302289785604</geo:x>
          <geo:y>37.36635688574164</geo:y>
        </geo:Point>
      </Coordinates>
    </DrivingToTree>
    
    <!-- Inspect first tree -->
    <Inspect id="1" locationRef="#1">
      <TaskDescription>Inspect tree with ID 1</TaskDescription>
    </Inspect>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
  
  <!-- Drive to second tree and inspect -->
  <DrivingToTree id="2">
    <Coordinates>
      <geo:Point xmlns:geo="http://www.w3.org/2003/07 GeoJSON">
        <geo:x>-120.42411109725654</geo:x>
        <geo:y>37.36745697894234</geo:y>
      </geo:Point>
    </Coordinates>
  </DrivingToTree>
  
  <Inspect id="2" locationRef="#2">
    <TaskDescription>Inspect tree with ID 2</TaskDescription>
  </Inspect>
</RobotMission>
```
This XML file defines a `RobotMission` with two tasks: driving to the first tree and inspecting it, and driving to the second tree and inspecting it. The coordinates of each location are provided in GeoJSON format.

Please note that you'll need to include the GeoJSON schema in your XML file for this to work properly. I can provide an example of how to do this if needed.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
           xmlns:geo="http://www.w3.org/2003/07 GeoJSON">
  <!-- ... -->
</xs:schema>
```
