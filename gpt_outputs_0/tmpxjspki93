Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

The user is facing an XML validation error related to an invalid element name in their mission planning XML file. Specifically, the error occurs at line 6, column 99, indicating that the start tag for a specific element is incorrect or non-existent.

To address this issue:

1. **Check Element Declaration**: Ensure that the root element and all other elements declared in your DOCTYPE are present in your XML file.
2. **Validate Namespace**: Confirm that any namespace declarations (using ` xmlns:`) match those expected by your mission planning system.
3. **Inspect Element Structure**: Make sure all tags have the correct name, case, and proper closure.

If you can share your XML file with the specific mission details, I can help ensure it adheres to these standards.
