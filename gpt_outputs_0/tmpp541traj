 Here's an example XML mission plan based on your requirements:
```php
<mission>
    <name>Picture 4 Trees</name>
    <description>Go north most, east most, south most, west most and take pictures of the trees.</description>
    <steps>
        <step id="1">
            <action type="move" direction="north"/>
            <action type="take_picture"/>
        </step>
        <step id="2">
            <action type="move" direction="east"/>
            <action type="take_picture"/>
        </step>
        <step id="3">
            <action type="move" direction="south"/>
            <action type="take_picture"/>
        </step>
        <step id="4">
            <action type="move" direction="west"/>
            <action type="take_picture"/>
        </step>
    </steps>
</mission>
```
This XML file defines a mission with 4 steps, each corresponding to moving in one of the cardinal directions (north, east, south, west) and taking a picture. The `<name>` and `<description>` elements provide information about the mission. The `<steps>` element contains the sequence of actions for the robot to perform. Each step is represented by an `<step>` element, which can contain one or more actions. In this case, each step has only one action: moving in a specific direction and taking a picture.

Note that the actual implementation of the `move` and `take_picture` actions would depend on the capabilities of your robot and the environment it operates in.
