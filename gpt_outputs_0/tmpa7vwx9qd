Okay, I understand. This error message indicates a problem with the XML structure – specifically, a mismatch between the opening and closing tags.  I need to carefully review the generated XML to identify and correct these tag errors. 

To help me resolve this, I need the following:

1.  **The XML File Content:** Please provide the entire XML file that was generated.  I need to see the structure and the specific tags involved in the error.
2.  **The GeoJSON File Content:**  Please provide the content of the GeoJSON file. This is crucial for referencing locations and data within the mission plan.

Once I have both the XML and GeoJSON files, I will:

*   Analyze the XML structure to pinpoint the tag mismatch.
*   Correct the errors to ensure the XML is valid and conforms to the expected schema.
*   Generate a new mission plan with the corrected XML.

I'll also pay close attention to the driving tasks and ensure they're logically structured.  I’ll include a comment in the `Outcome` section with the estimated total distance traveled.

**Let's start with the XML. Please paste the entire XML file content here.**

I'm ready when you are.  I’ll do my best to resolve this issue and create a valid mission plan.
