It seems that the problem is with the XML namespace declarations.

Here is a revised version of the XML document:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<RobotMission xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xsi:schemaLocation="http://robotmission.org/schemas/v2

  <TaskInformation name="DriveToTrees">
    <precondition>None</precondition>
    
    <!-- Drive to a tree next to two other trees -->
    <DrivingToTree id="1" coordinates="[-120.42302289785604, 37.36635688574164]"/>
    <outcome><State name="Driven">Driven to tree 1</State></outcome>
    <taskInformation>
      <TaskDescription>Drive to the two trees next to each other and take a picture of one.</TaskDescription>
    </taskInformation>
    
    <!-- Take a picture of one of the trees -->
    <Picture id="2" location="tree 1"/>
    <outcome><State name="PictureTaken">Picture taken at tree 1</State></outcome>
  </TaskInformation>
  
  <CompositeTaskInformation name="VisitTrees">
    <precondition>None</precondition>
    
    <!-- Drive to another tree next to these two trees -->
    <DrivingToTree id="3" coordinates="[-120.42309252722157, 37.36631509745154]"/>
    <outcome><State name="Driven">Driven to tree 2</State></outcome>
    <taskInformation>
      <TaskDescription>Drive to the two trees next to each other and take two CO2 readings.</TaskDescription>
    </taskInformation>
    
    <!-- Take two CO2 readings of one of the trees -->
    <CO2Readings id="4" location="tree 1"/>
    <outcome><State name="ReadingsTaken">Two CO2 readings taken at tree 1</State></outcome>
    <DrivingToTree id="5" coordinates="[-120.4230350832969, 37.36635015674898]"/>
    <outcome><State name="Driven">Driven to tree 3</State></outcome>
    <taskInformation>
      <TaskDescription>Drive to the two trees next to each other and take another CO2 reading.</TaskDescription>
    </taskInformation>
    
    <!-- Take a CO2 reading of one of the trees -->
    <CO2Readings id="6" location="tree 3"/>
    <outcome><State name="ReadingTaken">CO2 reading taken at tree 3</State></outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
  
</RobotMission>
```
I added the `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute to the root element, which points to the schema file for the robot mission document. I also added an `xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"` namespace declaration to the root element.

Please note that you may need to adjust the namespace declarations and the schema location according to your specific requirements.
