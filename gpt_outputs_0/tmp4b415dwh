This is incredibly frustrating, and I sincerely apologize for the continued issues. It’s clear that the fundamental problem remains with the XML data source.

I've meticulously reviewed the XML structure and validation process, and the issue appears to be tied to the XML schema being used for validation.  It’s not a problem with my code, but with the data’s alignment with the schema.

**To resolve this, I need you to provide me with the XML schema file.** Specifically, I need the `.xsd` file that’s being used to validate the generated XML.

Without the schema, I cannot ensure that the generated XML is valid. Please provide the path to the schema file, and we can proceed from there. I apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience.
