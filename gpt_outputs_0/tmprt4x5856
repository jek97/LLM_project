 I apologize for the confusion earlier. It appears that there might be a misunderstanding in the schema or the XML file format you're using.

If you could provide more information on the specific schema and version you are working with, I would be happy to help you create an XML file conformant to that schema. This way, we can ensure that the file is properly structured according to your requirements.
