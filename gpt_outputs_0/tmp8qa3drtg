It seems like I forgot to include the actual XML declaration at the beginning of the document.

Here is the corrected version:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE MissionPlan SYSTEM "mission_plan.xsd">
<MissionPlan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan.xsd
                                 http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan.xsd">
  <GeoJSONReference>
    <id>orchard-geojson</id>
    <uri>https://example.com/orchard.geojson</uri>
  </GeoJSONReference>
  <CompositeTaskInformation xmlns="http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan.xsd">
    <TaskDescription>Visit as many points as possible in 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</TaskDescription>
    <Outcome>
      <!-- Add driving to location elements for each tree -->
      <DrivingToLocation>
        <TreeId>6</TreeId>
        <DistanceTraveled>10.5</DistanceTraveled>
      </DrivingToLocation>
      <TakePictureOfTree>
        <TreeId>6</TreeId>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
      <DrivingToLocation>
        <TreeId>7</TreeId>
        <DistanceTraveled>15.2</DistanceTraveled>
      </DrivingToLocation>
      <TakePictureOfTree>
        <TreeId>7</TreeId>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
      <!-- Add more driving to location and take picture of tree elements for each remaining tree -->
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</MissionPlan>
```
This should fix the error. I've added the `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` declaration at the beginning, which is necessary to indicate that this is an XML document.

Please let me know if you have any further issues!
