It seems like the issue is still present.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of using XML tags, we can use a plain text format to represent the mission plan. Here is an example:
```
MissionPlan
CompositeTaskInformation
Start Mission
Outcome
DrivingToTree location="https://example.com/geojson/tree1.geojson"
TakePicture action="take_picture"
If picture_quality == "low"
TemperatureReading
If temperature_reading == "low"
CO2Sample
If co2_sample == "low"
DrivingToFarAwayTree location="https://example.com/geojson/tree2.geojson"
RepeatProcess
Else
DrivingToEnd location="https://example.com/geojson/endPoint.geojson"
EndIf
EndIf
EndTask
EndCompositeTaskInformation
```
This format uses a plain text representation of the XML tags, with each element on a new line and indentation used to show hierarchy.

Please try copying and pasting this into a text file or note-taking app, and then saving it as an XML file (or any other format that your parser supports). If you're still experiencing issues, please let me know and I'll be happy to help further!
