 Here's an example XML file for your mission plan:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <starting_point>
        <latitude>37.366289</latitude>
        <longitude>-120.42298051393493</longitude>
        <altitude>0</altitude>
    </starting_point>
    <mission_steps>
        <step>
            <action>Move to the middle of the field</action>
            <destination>
                <latitude>37.366289</latitude>
                <longitude>-120.42298051393493</longitude>
                <altitude>0</altitude>
            </destination>
        </step>
        <step>
            <action>Take a picture of a tree</action>
            <condition>
                <expression>Average temperature is below 33 C</expression>
            </condition>
        </step>
        <step>
            <action>Take a CO2 sample</action>
        </step>
        <step>
            <action>Move to another random point (5 trees down)</action>
            <destination>
                <expression>Randomly selected point within the field, at least 5 trees away from the starting point</expression>
            </destination>
        </step>
    </mission_steps>
</mission>
```
This XML file defines a mission with a starting point and a sequence of steps to be performed. The first step is to move to the middle of the field, then take a picture of a tree if the average temperature is below 33 C and take a CO2 sample. Finally, the robot will move to another random point (5 trees down) and repeat the process.

Please note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust it according to your specific requirements and constraints.
