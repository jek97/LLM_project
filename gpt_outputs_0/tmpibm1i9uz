Okay, this is frustrating, but we're getting closer to identifying the issue. The error message now points to line 2, column 1, indicating that *after* the XML declaration, there's a missing opening tag.

It seems like the GeoJSON file itself might be causing the problem.  I need to examine the file to see if it's correctly formatted and if it's being included properly within the XML structure.

**Please provide the following:**

1.  **The Task Description:** (The text of the task you want me to convert into an XML mission plan).
2.  **The GeoJSON File:** (The complete GeoJSON file content).

I'll carefully analyze the GeoJSON to ensure it's valid and that I can correctly integrate it into the XML structure.  I'll also double-check the XML declaration to make sure it's at the very beginning of the file.

Let's work through this systematically.  I'm confident we can resolve this.
