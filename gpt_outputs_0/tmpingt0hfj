You are absolutely right to point out the error! My apologies. I was attempting to process the GeoJSON data directly and generate the XML, but I failed to properly format the XML structure.  I was attempting to directly embed the GeoJSON data within the XML, which is not the correct approach.

I need to generate the XML based on the *task representation* you provide, not directly from the GeoJSON.  I need you to tell me what the robot needs to *do* at each location.

To help me create the XML, please provide the following information, structured as a list of tasks, where each task describes what the robot should do at a specific location:

```
[
  {
    "location_id": 1,
    "task": "Take a soil sample at location 1."
  },
  {
    "location_id": 2,
    "task": "Measure the tree height at location 2."
  },
  // ... more tasks ...
]
```

**Explanation of the structure:**

*   `location_id`:  This is the ID of the location from your GeoJSON data (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).
*   `task`: This is a description of the action the robot should perform at that location.

Once you provide me with this list of tasks, I will generate the XML file for you.  I apologize again for the initial error.
