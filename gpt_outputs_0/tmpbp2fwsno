Alright, so I'm trying to help someone fix an XML mission plan they're working on. The user mentioned that there's another error now:

An error occurred: StartTag: invalid element name at line 15, column 112 of the temporary file `tmppb2sawqr`.

This seems similar to previous issues but occurring at a different location.

Firstly, I need to understand what this new error means. The "StartTag: invalid element name" suggests that somewhere in their XML file, there's an opening tag `<tagname>` where `tagname` is not a valid XML element according to the schema being used. XML element names must follow specific rules; they can't contain certain characters or be duplicated.

Given that it's at line 15 and column 112 in `tmppb2sawqr`, this indicates that somewhere around those lines, there might have been a mistake in defining an XML tag. It could be:

- A typo where the element name was misspelled.
- An invalid character being included in the tag name.
- Perhaps even an incorrect use of an existing tag without a proper namespace.

To fix this error:

1. **Locate the Error**: Open the XML mission plan and find exactly where `<invalid_elementname>` is located at line 15, column 112.

2. **Check Tag Validity**: Ensure that all tags in your XML file are valid according to the schema they're using. If you're using an OGC SRS (Simple Resource System) for mission planning, make sure none of the tags have been incorrectly altered or added.

3. **Look for Copy-Paste Errors**: Check if any part of the mission plan was copied and pasted incorrectly, which might have introduced malformed tags into the XML file.

4. **Validate XML Structure**: After correcting any issues found in steps 1-3, use an XML validator to check for syntax errors throughout your entire XML mission plan document. This will help catch other potential issues that might exist due to improper formatting or schema usage.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that each section of your mission plan adheres strictly to its intended schema to prevent such errors from occurring in the future.

By carefully reviewing and validating your XML mission plan, you can resolve the invalid start tag error at this specific location. Correcting any malformations in the mission plan should fix this particular issue.

To address the "StartTag: invalid element name" error at line 15, column 112:

1. **Locate the Error**: Open the XML mission plan and locate exactly where `<invalid_elementname>` is present at line 15, column 112.

2. **Check Tag Validity**: Ensure that all tags in your XML file are valid according to the schema they're using. For example, if you're using an OGC SRS (Simple Resource System) schema for mission planning, verify that none of the tags have been incorrectly altered or added with malformed names.

3. **Look for Copy-Paste Errors**: Check if any part of the mission plan was copied and pasted incorrectly, which might have introduced malformed tags into the XML file. This could include typos or incorrect tag definitions from other parts of the document being inadvertently duplicated here.

4. **Validate XML Structure**: After making corrections in steps 1-3, use an XML validator to check for syntax errors throughout your entire XML mission plan document. This will ensure that all tags are properly defined and adhere to the specified schemas, preventing similar issues from recurring.

By carefully reviewing and validating your XML mission plan, you can resolve the invalid start tag error at this specific location. Correcting any malformations in the mission plan should fix this particular issue while maintaining compliance with your project's schema requirements.
