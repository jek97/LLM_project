Okay, I understand. This error message indicates that the XML structure I'm generating doesn't conform to the expected schema. Specifically, it's missing a root element, which is essential for XML documents.

I need you to provide me with the following information to generate a valid XML mission plan:

1.  **The Task Description:**  Please paste the text of the original question you want me to use as the `TaskDescription` within the `CompositeTaskInformation` element. This is the core of the mission.

2.  **The GeoJSON Data:** Please provide the GeoJSON data that contains the locations of the trees, GPS coordinates, and other relevant features.  This data will be referenced within the XML mission plan.

Once you provide me with these two pieces of information, I will generate the XML mission plan, ensuring it's well-formed and conforms to the expected schema.  I will also include the estimated haversine distance traveled in a comment within the `Outcome` element.

Let's start with the Task Description. Please paste the original question here.
