Alright, so the user is getting another XML validation error in their mission planning XML file. The error message says there's an "invalid element name" on line 16, column 103 with the tag `tmphdxqagy9`. 

Hmm, this seems familiar. They must have a typo or undefined custom tag somewhere in their XML file.

First, I should consider possible reasons for this error:

1. **Undefined Custom Tag**: Maybe they have a custom element name like `tmphdxqagy9` that isn't properly defined.
   
2. **Extra Characters or Data**: There could be extra characters at the end of the document causing issues.
   
3. **Whitespace Issues**: Sometimes, trailing whitespace can mess up validation.

To fix this:

1. **Check for Custom Tags**: Ensure `tmphdxqagy9` is declared properly if it's a custom tag.

2. **Validate XML Structure**: Make sure all elements are closed and nested correctly.

3. **Inspect the End of the File**: Look beyond line 16, column 103 for any extra content or characters.

4. **Use Validation Tools**: Tools like `xml validators` can help pinpoint where things go wrong.

5. **Review GeoJSON References**: Ensure all referenced elements are correctly formatted and within schema expectations.

If this tag isn't needed, replacing it with a standard name like `Tree` might solve the problem without affecting functionality.

I should ask them to provide more details or share the XML file for a more specific solution.

It seems there's an issue with your XML file structure. The error message indicates that there is "invalid element name" on line 16, column 103 in your mission plan XML file, specifically for the tag `tmphdxqagy9`. This suggests that either:

1. There is a typo or undefined custom tag (`tmphdxqagy9`) somewhere in your XML file.
2. There are extra characters or data at the end of the document causing validation issues.
3. There might be trailing whitespace or comments that are not properly handled.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check for Custom Tags**: Ensure `tmphdxqagy9` is declared properly if it's a custom tag. If it's not needed, consider removing it and using a standard XML element name instead (e.g., replace it with `Tree` or another appropriate element).

2. **Validate XML Structure**: Make sure all tags are properly closed and nested. Extra tags at the end can cause validation errors.

3. **Inspect the End of the File**: Look beyond line 16, column 103 for any extra characters or data that might be causing issues.

4. **Use XML Validation Tools**: Tools like `xml validators` or schema validators can help identify where the problem lies and pinpoint invalid elements.

5. **Review GeoJSON References**: Ensure all referenced elements in your GeoJSON are correctly formatted and within the expected schema boundaries.

If you provide more details about your XML file or share it, I can offer a more specific solution to fix this issue.
