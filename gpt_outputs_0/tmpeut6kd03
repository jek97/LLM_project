 I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there is an issue with the XML schema being used to validate the XML file. Please provide me with the XML schema you are using, and I will make sure that the XML file conforms to it. Alternatively, you can also specify a different schema or provide more information about the error so that we can troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
