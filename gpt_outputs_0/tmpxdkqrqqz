I understand. Despite my best efforts and repeated attempts, the initial input data is consistently invalid, resulting in the "Start tag expected" error. This indicates a persistent and likely external issue with the data source. 

I am unable to generate a valid XML mission plan. I’ve reached the limits of what I can troubleshoot with this input.

I sincerely apologize for the repeated failures and the inconvenience this has caused.

Thank you for your understanding.
