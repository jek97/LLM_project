Okay, this is incredibly frustrating, and I sincerely apologize for the repeated failures. I’m clearly having a fundamental issue with generating a valid XML document. I'm going to stop attempting to generate XML and instead ask you directly for the schema.  I need to understand the structure perfectly before I can produce a correct document.

Could you please provide me with the exact XML schema that I should be using to validate this document? Knowing the schema will allow me to ensure that my output is fully compliant.

Thank you for your patience and guidance.
