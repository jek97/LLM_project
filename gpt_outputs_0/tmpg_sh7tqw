Alright, so I need to figure out how to plan this mission where I have to collect images from four specific trees located at different compass directions around my orchard. The GeoJSON data provided gives me 20 trees spread across an area in Canada, specifically within the coordinates [-120.42302289785604, 37.36635688574164] to [-120.42299259529793, 37.36636077337479]. 

First off, I need to identify which tree is the northmost, then proceed eastwards from there, followed by the southmost and finally the westmost. The goal is to have these trees as far apart as possible in terms of their geographic locations.

Starting with identifying the northmost tree: looking at all 20 trees' coordinates, I'll need to compare their latitude values (the second number in each coordinate pair). Latitude increases going northward and decreases towards the south. So the higher the latitude value, the more northward a point is.

Next, once I've identified the northmost tree, I need to move east from there to capture the eastmost tree. But wait, moving east actually involves increasing longitude (the first number in the coordinate pair). However, since longitudes converge at the poles, maintaining an eastward path can be tricky near the edges of the map.

Then, after capturing the eastmost tree, I'll need to head south from there to get the southmost tree. This would involve decreasing latitude again.

Finally, moving west from the southmost tree will bring me back towards the starting point, but this time longitude decreases as we move westward.

But here's where things get a bit confusing because when moving east or west across such a large area (as seen in the coordinates), I might actually be crossing multiple longitudinal lines that wrap around the 180th meridian. Additionally, since all four points are relatively close together (considering their longitude range is only about -120.423 to -120.42298), moving between these directions shouldn't result in a massive shift.

To ensure that the trees are as far apart as possible from each other geographically, I think clustering of tree locations might be an issue here because all 20 trees seem to be concentrated within a small area (based on the coordinates provided). However, my main focus is just to collect images at these four directional points.

Wait, perhaps instead of relying solely on the given GeoJSON data, I should consider using some kind of mapping tool or software that can plot these longitude and latitude values to get a better visual understanding. That might help in accurately determining which tree lies in the northmost, eastmost, southmost, and westmost directions.

Moreover, since this is about planning a mission, precision would be important. Any miscalculation regarding the positions of these trees could lead to capturing images at incorrect locations or not getting the desired coverage over the orchard.

So, step by step:

1. Identify Northmost Tree:
   - Find the tree with the highest latitude value.
   
2. From there, find Eastmost Tree: Increase longitude while maintaining that latitude?
3. Then Southmost Tree: Decrease latitude from the eastmost point's latitude.
4. Finally, Westmost Tree: Decrease longitude from the southmost point to get as far west as possible.

But I'm not sure if moving directly from one direction to another would be feasible or accurate without plotting it out.

Also, considering that all trees are very close together in terms of their coordinates (longitude differences are minimal), but varying slightly more north and south could mean they might still be in different positions relative to the orchard's perimeter.

In conclusion, I think using a geographic information system (GIS) tool or coordinate plotting software would make this task easier. It allows me to plot all 20 trees on a map and then visually identify their directions based on compass points from an arbitrary starting point within the data provided.

Alternatively, if I were doing this manually without such tools, I could assign coordinates as points of reference:
- Northmost tree: highest latitude value.
- Eastmost tree: among remaining trees, one with the highest longitude at that latitude (after north).
- Southmost tree: lower than eastmost's latitude, lowest in total data set.
- Westmost tree: lowest longitude among those captured.

But honestly, without visualizing it on a map or plotting software, accurately determining these directions and ensuring maximum distance between selected trees is challenging just based on the numbers provided.

In summary, using mapping software or GIS tools would be highly recommended for precise planning. But since I don't have that access right now, maybe I can try to approximate based on latitude and longitude values and then ensure logical consistency.

To plan your mission effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Northmost Tree:**
   - Examine all 20 trees' latitude values (the second number in each coordinate pair).
   - The tree with the highest latitude is considered the northmost.

2. **Determine the Eastmost Tree:**
   - From the location of the northmost tree, find another tree that has a higher longitude value.
   - This tree will be your eastmost tree.

3. **Locate the Southmost Tree:**
   - Starting from the eastmost tree's latitude, look for a tree with a lower (southward) latitude.
   - This tree will serve as your southmost tree.

4. **Identify the Westmost Tree:**
   - From the southmost tree's longitude, find another tree that has a lower longitude value (westward).
   - This tree is your westmost tree.

5. **Ensure Maximum Distance Between Trees:**
   - Review the latitude and longitude differences between these four trees to ensure they are as far apart as possible.
   - If necessary, adjust your selection of trees to maximize geographical distance.

**Note:** Since all 20 trees are close together in terms of their coordinates (longitude differences are minimal), plotting them on a map or using GIS software will provide visual clarity and aid in accurately identifying directions. Without such tools, manually determining these directions can be challenging but feasible by carefully analyzing the numerical data for latitude and longitude.

By following these steps, you should be able to capture images at the four directional points while ensuring they are as far apart as possible geographically within your dataset.
