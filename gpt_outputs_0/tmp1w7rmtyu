 Here's an example XML file for your mission plan:
```php
<mission>
  <task name="Take a picture of the first tree">
    <step name="Take a picture of the first tree"/>
  </task>
  <task name="Measure the CO2 level in the first tree">
    <step name="Check the CO2 reading in the first tree"/>
    <if condition="CO2 reading is low">
      <step name="Take a CO2 sample"/>
      <step name="Confirm the CO2 reading by taking another CO2 sample"/>
    </if>
  </task>
  <task name="Measure another tree, a different one">
    <step name="Take a picture of the second tree"/>
    <if condition="CO2 reading is low">
      <step name="Take a CO2 sample"/>
      <if condition="Confirmation CO2 reading is low">
        <step name="Continue driving to another tree and take another CO2 sample"/>
      </if>
    </if>
  </task>
  <end/>
</mission>
```
This XML file describes a mission with three tasks: taking a picture of the first tree, measuring the CO2 level in the first tree, and measuring another tree. The `<if>` elements are used to conditionally execute steps based on the results of previous steps.
