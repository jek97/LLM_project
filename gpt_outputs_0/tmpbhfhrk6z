Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where the user is getting an XML validation error saying "StartTag: invalid element name" on line 4, column 99. Let me try to figure out what's going on here.

First, I know that XML has a specific set of valid element names it recognizes. If there's an element with a name that doesn't match any known XML tag, the parser will throw this kind of error. The user mentioned that their mission plan is supposed to be based on a known schema, so maybe they're missing something in their composite task information or nested tasks.

Looking at line 4, column 99, I'm guessing there's an element name there that's not valid. Maybe it's part of the CompositeTaskInformation or another nested task. If I recall correctly, XML elements must be properly declared and closed without any typos.

Perhaps they have a tag like `<InvalidElement>` by accident instead of something else. Or maybe it's a nested structure where an element isn't closing properly before moving on to another one. For example, if there are multiple task descriptions or composite tasks that aren't correctly nested or closed.

I should also consider the possibility of missing attributes or invalid characters within elements. XML doesn't allow certain characters unless they're part of defined entities. If any extra characters were added mistakenly after a valid tag, it could cause this error.

Another angle is that there might be an empty element at the end of the file without being properly closed. Sometimes developers forget to close tags, and since line 4 is in the middle of the mission plan, maybe there's an unclosed tag or an extra one somewhere else.

To fix this, I need to check for invalid XML element names across the entire document. Starting from the root, each nested task should have valid elements declared before they're used. Maybe there's a typo in the composite task information that's causing an unexpected element name when parsing continues.

I'll suggest verifying each tag declaration and ensuring all attributes are correctly specified without any trailing or invalid characters. Also, checking for proper nesting of tags is crucial to prevent XML from getting confused about which elements are open and need closing.

If after correcting these issues the error persists, it might be helpful to look at a specific section of the mission plan where multiple tasks are nested together because improper handling there could lead to unexpected element names.

To resolve the "StartTag: invalid element name" error in your XML mission plan, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Invalid Element Name:**
   - The error occurs at line 4, column 99. Look for an element with this position and check its name.

2. **Verify Element Names Against Valid XML Tags:**
   - Ensure that every `<tag>` in your XML is declared and recognized by XML as valid. You can cross-reference the XML schema or DTD provided for your mission plan to ensure all elements are correctly defined.

3. **Check for Typos or Mistyped Elements:**
   - Carefully examine the XML file around line 4, column 99. It's possible that a tag was misspelled or mistyped as an invalid element name by accident.

4. **Examine Nested Task Definitions:**
   - If line 4 is part of a nested task definition within `CompositeTaskInformation` or another structure, ensure all tags are properly closed before moving to the next task. Proper nesting prevents unexpected elements from being encountered.

5. **Validate Attributes and Characters:**
   - Ensure that attributes within elements do not contain invalid characters unless they're declared in your XML schema.
   - Check for any extra characters after a valid tag declaration, as these can cause unexpected element names or invalid structures.

6. **Close Tags Properly:**
   - Make sure all tags are properly closed without mismatching (e.g., ensuring every `<tag>` has a corresponding `</tag>`) and in the correct order to maintain XML validity.

7. **Use an XML Validator:**
   - Open your XML mission plan file in an XML validator tool like W3Schools' XML validator or Lrace, which can highlight invalid elements and help pinpoint where the error occurs.

8. **Check for Missing or Extra Closing Tags:**
   - Ensure that no tags are left unclosed at any point in the XML document, as this can cause unexpected element names or errors when parsing continues.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and correct the invalid element name causing the error. If the issue persists after making these adjustments, please provide more details about the XML content around line 4, column 99, so I can offer further assistance.
