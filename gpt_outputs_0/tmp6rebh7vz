Here is an example of a mission plan XML document based on the provided GeoJSON data:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<MissionPlan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan.xsd
                                 http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan.xsd">
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Visit as many points as possible in 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</TaskDescription>
    <Outcome>
      <DrivingToLocation>
        <TreeId>6</TreeId>
      </DrivingToLocation>
      <TakePictureOfTree>
        <TreeId>6</TreeId>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
      <DrivingToLocation>
        <TreeId>7</TreeId>
      </DrivingToLocation>
      <TakePictureOfTree>
        <TreeId>7</TreeId>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
      <!-- Add more DrivingToLocation and TakePictureOfTree elements for each tree visited -->
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
  <GeoJSONReference>
    <id>orchard-geojson</id>
    <uri>https://example.com/orchard.geojson</uri>
  </GeoJSONReference>
</MissionPlan>
```
Note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements. Additionally, the `DrivingToLocation` and `TakePictureOfTree` elements are assumed to be part of a larger schema for robotic task representation.

Also, I've commented out some of the `DrivingToLocation` and `TakePictureOfTree` elements to show how you can add more trees to visit. You'll need to update these elements with the actual tree IDs from your GeoJSON data.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further modifications!
