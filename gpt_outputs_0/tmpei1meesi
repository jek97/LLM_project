Alright, so I'm getting this XML validation error saying "Extra content at the end of the document" on line 25. Hmm, that means somewhere there's more text or something after where it should stop, right? Let me think about how to approach this.

First off, in XML, every opening tag needs a closing tag. If I have tags like `<root>` but no `</root>`, the parser might get confused and throw an error when it reaches the end of the document. So maybe line 25 is where that extra content starts, perhaps some text or another element that wasn't properly closed.

Also, sometimes comments can be at the end if there's a trailing whitespace or leftover characters after the last tag. Maybe I need to remove any trailing characters that aren't part of an element name.

Let me try looking through my XML file up to line 25. Is everything properly closed? Let me check each opening tag: `<ns>`, `<CompositeTaskInformation>`, etc., and ensure they all have their closing tags in the right order.

If I see extra text after a closing tag, like `</CompositeTaskInformation>text`, that would cause an error because there's unexpected content. So trimming any trailing whitespace or text could fix it.

Maybe using a tool to check for malformed XML would help pinpoint exactly where this issue is occurring. I should also make sure all the attributes are correctly assigned and that elements aren't nested improperly, causing unexpected behavior at line 25.

If after checking, everything still looks correct but there's still an error, maybe adding some debugging statements or log files could provide more insight into why it's considering extra content at this specific point.

The error message "Extra content at the end of the document" indicates that your XML file has extra text or characters beyond its last element. Here's how to address this:

1. **Check for Proper Tag Closure**: Ensure every opening tag (e.g., `<ns>`) is closed with a corresponding `</ns>`.

2. **Examine Trailing Characters**: Look for any text, whitespace, or comments after the last closing tag at line 25 that shouldn't be present.

3. **Remove Trailing Whitespace**: Clean up any trailing spaces or unintended content after the final element to prevent XML validation errors.

4. **Validate with Tools**: Use an XML validator to check for malformed content beyond line 25, ensuring everything is properly structured and closed.

By systematically checking each of these areas, you can identify and correct the issue causing the "Extra content at the end" error in your XML file.
