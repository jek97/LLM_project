It seems that the XML parser is expecting a start tag (`<`) at the beginning of the file. Here is the corrected version:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<missionPlan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.example.com/mission-plan.xsd
             http://www.example.com/mission-plan.xsd">
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Visit trees in 100m radius and take pictures</TaskDescription>
    <Outcome>
      <DrivingToTree location="[-120.42302289785604, 37.36635688574164]"/>
      <TakePicture treeId="0"/>
      <DrivingToTree location="[-120.42309252722157, 37.36631509745154]"/>
      <TakePicture treeId="1"/>
      <!-- ... -->
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</missionPlan>
```
I added the opening `<` character to the `missionPlan` element.

However, I noticed that the GeoJSON data is quite large and would be better represented as a separate XML file or even a JSON file. Here's an example of how you could represent it in XML:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<geojson>
  <FeatureCollection>
    <Feature>
      <geometry>
        <Point>
          <coordinates>
            -120.42302289785604
            37.36635688574164
          </coordinates>
        </Point>
      </geometry>
      <properties>
        <treeId>0</treeId>
      </properties>
    </Feature>
    <!-- ... -->
  </FeatureCollection>
</geojson>
```
This would allow you to easily add or remove features from the collection. Let me know if you have any further questions!
