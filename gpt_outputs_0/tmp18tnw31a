Alright, so I have this XML mission plan that's been giving me a "Extra content" error on line 29. Let me try to figure out what's going on and how to fix it.

First off, I know that XML files are supposed to be really strict about their structure. Every opening tag needs to have a corresponding closing tag in the right order without any extra characters or data floating around at the end of the file. The error is pointing me to line 29, column 1, so there's something out of place there.

I'm thinking that maybe I've accidentally added an extra string or character somewhere when editing the XML file. Perhaps it was left over from a previous run or someone appended some random text at the end by mistake. I should carefully check each line up to line 29 to make sure everything is in order and that there's no unintended content.

Another possibility is that my script, which converts GeoJSON points into this XML mission plan, has an issue where it's appending extra data unintentionally. Maybe leftover strings from previous runs are still hanging around somewhere in the code. I should look through my scripts to see if anything like that could be happening.

Also, when I save or copy-paste parts of the XML file manually, sometimes unexpected characters can get introduced into certain sections. If I'm not careful, that extra content might end up at the end of the document, causing this error. I should make sure to proofread every step carefully before saving the mission plan.

To solve this, my first move is going to be a manual review of the XML file line by line up until line 29. I'll look for any characters or tags that don't belong there and remove them if they're causing issues. If possible, I'll also try using an XML validator tool like XMLSpy or W3Schools' XML validator to highlight any problematic areas.

If the issue persists after these adjustments, I might need to check my script again. Maybe there's a part of the code where extra data is being added intentionally when it shouldn't be. Cleaning up any leftover strings from previous runs should help eliminate that extra content at line 29.

Once everything is cleaned up and the mission plan looks good without any extra characters, I'll run through it once more using the XML validator to make sure all elements are correctly nested and nothing's missing or misplaced. This should clear up the "Extra content" error.

In summary, my approach will be:
1. Manually review each line of the XML file up to line 29 for any unintended extra content.
2. Use XML validation tools to identify and correct any structural issues.
3. Check the script converting GeoJSON points into XML mission plans for any unintentional data appending.
4. Clean up any leftover strings or characters that might have slipped through during processing.
5. Revalidate the entire XML file to ensure it's well-structured and free of errors.

By following these steps, I should be able to resolve the "Extra content" error on line 29 and have a properly structured XML mission plan ready for use. Safe travels!
