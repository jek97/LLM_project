It seems like the issue is with the namespace declaration. The `xmlns` attribute should be used in conjunction with a prefix.

Here is the corrected version:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE MissionPlan SYSTEM "mission_plan.xsd">
<MissionPlan xmlns:mti="http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan
                                 http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan.xsd">
  <GeoJSONReference>
    <id>orchard-geojson</id>
    <uri>https://example.com/orchard.geojson</uri>
  </GeoJSONReference>
  <CompositeTaskInformation mti:TaskDescription="Visit as many points as possible in 100 meters and take pictures of each tree."
                            mti:Outcome>
    <!-- Add driving to location elements for each tree -->
    <DrivingToLocation>
      <TreeId>6</TreeId>
      <DistanceTraveled>10.5</DistanceTraveled>
    </DrivingToLocation>
    <TakePictureOfTree>
      <TreeId>6</TreeId>
    </TakePictureOfTree>
    <DrivingToLocation>
      <TreeId>7</TreeId>
      <DistanceTraveled>15.2</DistanceTraveled>
    </DrivingToLocation>
    <TakePictureOfTree>
      <TreeId>7</TreeId>
    </TakePictureOfTree>
    <!-- Add more driving to location and take picture of tree elements for each remaining tree -->
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</MissionPlan>
```
This should fix the error. I've added the `mti` prefix to the namespace declaration, which allows us to use it consistently throughout the document.

Please let me know if you have any further issues!
