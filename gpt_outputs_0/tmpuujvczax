The error message you're encountering is because the XML schema provided in the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation attribute of the mission element does not match any known schemas.
To resolve this issue, please make sure that you have the correct schema file and provide its location in the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation attribute. The schema should be a valid XSD (XML Schema Definition) file that defines the structure and data types for your XML file.
Alternatively, you can remove the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation attribute if you don't need to validate the XML against any schema.
