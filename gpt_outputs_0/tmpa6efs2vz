Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's getting an XML validation error when generating a mission plan. The error message says there's an invalid StartTag at line 89, column 79 with the element name "tmp33szzs8h". Hmm, that sounds like it's some custom tag they're using in their XML file.

First, I need to figure out why this is happening. Maybe they have a typo or a custom element defined elsewhere but not included correctly. The user mentioned using a GeoJSON file for references, so perhaps the issue is with how they're referencing elements from that JSON within their XML mission plan.

I should check if all the tags in their XML are valid and properly declared. If "tmp33szzs8h" isn't a standard element, it's likely causing an error. They might need to replace it with a correct tag name or define it properly using DTD or schema validation.

Also, they mentioned tasks should almost always require driving to a tree first. So I'll make sure the CompositeTaskInformation and TaskDescription elements are correctly structured, referencing the GeoJSON data accurately.

I'll suggest they review their XML structure for any typos or missing declarations. Maybe adding some debugging tools could help pinpoint where exactly the error is occurring. If it's due to an undefined custom tag, replacing it with a standard one like "Tree" would make sense if that's what they intended.

It seems there might be an issue with your XML file structure or content. The error message indicates that there is an invalid StartTag at line 89, column 79 in your mission plan XML file. This suggests that either:

1. You have a custom element name (e.g., `tmp33szzs8h`) that is not properly defined or declared.
2. There is a typo in the element name.

To resolve this issue, please ensure that all elements in your XML file are valid and conform to the schema you're using. If you're using custom tags, make sure they are properly defined with `<!DOCTYPE>` or within a DTD declaration.

If the error is due to an undefined tag (e.g., `tmp33szzs8h`), please replace it with a valid XML element name that matches your intended structure.

Also, ensure that all tags are properly closed and nested. If you're using GeoJSON data references within your mission plan, make sure they are correctly formatted and referenced according to the schema requirements.

If you can provide more details about the specific XML file or the exact error message, I can offer a more tailored solution.
