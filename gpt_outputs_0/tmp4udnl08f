 Here is an example of a mission plan XML document that visits as many trees as possible within 100 meters and takes pictures of each tree:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <name>Tree Picture Mission</name>
    <description>Visit as many trees as possible within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</description>
    <start_point>
        <x>0.42307592599273</x>
        <y>0.36636077337479</y>
    </start_point>
    <end_point>
        <x>0.42307592599273</x>
        <y>0.36636077337479</y>
    </end_point>
    <tasks>
        <task id="1">
            <name>Visit Tree 1 and Take Picture</name>
            <description>Visit tree 1 and take a picture of it.</description>
            <position>
                <x>0.42307592599273</x>
                <y>0.36636077337479</y>
            </position>
        </task>
        <!-- Add more tasks here -->
    </tasks>
</mission>
```
This XML file defines a mission with a name and description, as well as start and end points. The `<tasks>` element contains one or more `<task>` elements, each of which represents a specific task to be performed by the robot. In this example, there is only one task defined: visiting tree 1 and taking a picture of it.

You can add more tasks as needed, following the same structure as the first task. Each task should have a unique `id` attribute for identification purposes. The `<position>` element within each task specifies the location of the tree to be visited and photographed.

Note that this is just an example, and you can customize it according to your specific requirements and mission objectives.
