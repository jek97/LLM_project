    <Action>Measure the CO2 levels with the sensors</Action>
  </Task>
  <Task id="3">
    <Type>Move to the next task location</Type>
    <Action>Navigate to the next location using the GPS system</Action>

  <!-- Add more tasks and locations as needed -->
</RoboticMissionPlan>
```
This XML file represents a robotic mission plan with three tasks: taking a picture of two trees, taking CO2 readings of two trees, and moving to the next task location. The tasks are organized in a hierarchy, with each task having a unique identifier (id). The action for each task is also included in the file. You can add more tasks and locations as needed by following the same structure.
