 The XML file for this mission plan would look something like this:
```php
<mission>
    <starting_point>0</starting_point>
    <destination>9</destination>
    <activity type="photo">
        <description>Take a picture of a tree.</description>
    </activity>
    <activity type="temperature">
        <description>Check the average temperature of the tree.</description>
    </activity>
    <activity type="sample">
        <description>Collect CO2 samples if the temperature is below 33°C.</description>
    </activity>
    <destination>14</destination>
    <activity type="photo">
        <description>Take a picture of a tree.</description>
    </activity>
    <activity type="temperature">
        <description>Check the average temperature of the tree.</description>
    </activity>
    <activity type="sample">
        <description>Collect CO2 samples if the temperature is below 33°C.</description>
    </activity>
</mission>
```
This XML file represents a mission plan where the robot starts at position 0, moves to position 9 to take a picture of a tree and check its average temperature. If the temperature is below 33°C, it collects CO2 samples. The robot then moves to position 14 to repeat the same process.

The XML file includes tags for the starting point, destination, and activities (photo, temperature, sample) that the robot will perform at each location. Each activity has a description attribute that provides additional information about what the robot will do.
