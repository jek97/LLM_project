 It looks like there is an issue with the XML syntax in the mission plan provided. In order to resolve this issue, we need to make sure that all opening and closing tags are properly nested and formatted.

Here's an updated version of the mission plan:
```php
<Mission>
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Move to Tree and Pick Leaves</TaskDescription>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
  <DriveToLocation>
    <StartingLocation>{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.1,0.2]}</StartingLocation>
    <EndingLocation>{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.3,0.4]}</EndingLocation>
  </DriveToLocation>
  <PerformTask>
    <TaskDescription>Collect Leaves from Tree</TaskDescription>
    <PerformedAction>Pick Leaves</PerformedAction>
  </PerformTask>
  <Move to Location and Perform Task Again>
    <StartingLocation>{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.4,0.5]}</StartingLocation>
    <EndingLocation>{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.5,0.6]}</EndingLocation>
  </Move to Location and Perform Task Again>
  <DriveToLocation>
    <StartingLocation>{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.4,0.5]}</StartingLocation>
    <EndingLocation>{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.6,0.7]}</EndingLocation>
  </DriveToLocation>
  <PerformTask>
    <TaskDescription>Collect Leaves from Tree</TaskDescription>
    <PerformedAction>Pick Leaves</PerformedAction>
  </PerformTask>
</Mission>
```
In this updated mission plan, all opening and closing tags are properly nested and formatted. The starting and ending locations for each drive are provided using GeoJSON format, which includes a type and coordinates for the location. The task description for each action is included in the `TaskDescription` element of the `CompositeTaskInformation` element for logging purposes.
