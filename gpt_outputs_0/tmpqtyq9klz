Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

**Step 1: Understanding the Issue**

The user is encountering an "Extra content at the end of the document" error when generating a mission plan. This suggests that there's unexpected data beyond what's expected in their GeoJSON file at line 50, column 1.

**Step 2: Reviewing the GeoJSON Structure**

I looked at the provided GeoJSON snippet and noticed it correctly follows JSON standards with points containing longitude and latitude coordinates.

**Step 3: Identifying Potential Causes**

- **Extra Features**: More than four trees might be present.
- **Typographical Errors**: Extra characters or commas disrupting the JSON structure.
- **Missing Characters**: Unescaped quotes causing parsing issues.

**Step 4: Analyzing the Provided Data**

Only one point is visible, but the user intends to have four specific trees (northernmost, easternmost, southernmost, westernmost). The extra content at line 50 could be due to additional features or formatting errors.

**Step 5: Ensuring Proper JSON Formatting**

- **Bracket and Comma Check**: Ensure all brackets are properly closed.
- **Escape Special Characters**: Properly escape any quotes within data fields.

**Step 6: Validating the GeoJSON Data**

Using a validator can help spot structural issues like missing or extra braces, ensuring each feature is correctly enclosed.

**Step 7: Checking for Redundant Data**

Extract only the necessary four points to avoid processing unnecessary features and reduce potential errors.

**Step 8: Ensuring Correct Longitude and Latitude Values**

Each tree should have unique longitude values; otherwise, determining "westernmost" becomes challenging without varied data.

**Step 9: Suggested Actions**

- **Data Collection Verification**: Ensure each tree's data includes unique coordinates.
- **JSON Validation**: Use a validator to check syntax and content integrity.
- **Manual Review**: Inspect the GeoJSON file for any unexpected characters or trailing commas.

**Step 10: Conclusion**

The error is likely due to extra content in the GeoJSON file beyond what's needed for four trees. Proper validation, subset extraction, and data cleaning can resolve these issues.

To address your request, here's a step-by-step explanation based on the provided GeoJSON data:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The user is encountering an error when generating a mission plan due to extra content in their GeoJSON file at line 50, column 1.

2. **Reviewing the GeoJSON Structure**:
   - The provided GeoJSON snippet appears correctly formatted with points having longitude and latitude coordinates.

3. **Identifying Potential Issues**:
   - Extra features beyond four trees might cause issues.
   - Typographical errors could disrupt JSON parsing.

4. **Analyzing the Provided Data**:
   - Only one point is visible, but the user intends to have four specific trees (northernmost, easternmost, southernmost, westernmost).

5. **Investigating the Error**:
   - The error suggests unexpected content at line 50, column 1.
   - This could be due to extra features or formatting issues.

6. **Ensuring Proper JSON Formatting**:
   - Verify all brackets and commas are properly closed.
   - Check for any trailing commas or unexpected text.

7. **Validating the GeoJSON Data**:
   - Use a JSON validator to ensure correct structure, including proper use of square brackets and correct formatting of coordinates.

8. **Checking for Redundant Data**:
   - Ensure only four points are present as needed.
   - If extra features exist, consider extracting only the required data.

9. **Ensuring Correct Longitude and Latitude Values**:
   - Since all provided points share the same longitude (-120.42301589765625), ensure each tree has unique values for accurate positioning.

10. **Suggested Actions**:
    - **Verify Data Collection**: Ensure each tree's data includes unique coordinates.
    - **Validate JSON Structure**: Use a validator to check syntax and content integrity.
    - **Inspect File Content**: Manually review the GeoJSON file for any unexpected characters or trailing commas.

11. **Conclusion**:
    - The error is likely due to extra content in the GeoJSON file beyond what's needed for four trees.
    - Proper validation, subset extraction, and data cleaning can resolve these issues.
