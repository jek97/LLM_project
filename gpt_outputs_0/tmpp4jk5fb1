The error message you're encountering is because the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation attribute in the mission element points to a schema that does not exist or is not accessible from where you are running your XML file.
To resolve this issue, please make sure that you have the correct schema file and provide its location in the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation attribute. The schema should be a valid XSD (XML Schema Definition) file that defines the structure and data types for your XML file.
Alternatively, you can remove the xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation attribute if you don't need to validate the XML against any schema.
