 I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. It seems that there was an issue with the XML structure again. Here is the corrected XML mission plan:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
  <name>Picture Four Trees</name>
  <description>Take a picture of each tree in the given order: north most, east most, south most, west most.</description>
  
  <task name="North Most Tree">
    <action>Move to North Most Tree</action>
    <action>Take Picture</action>
  </task>
  
  <task name="East Most Tree">
    <action>Move to East Most Tree</action>
    <action>Take Picture</action>
  </task>
  
  <task name="South Most Tree">
    <action>Move to South Most Tree</action>
    <action>Take Picture</action>
  </task>
  
  <task name="West Most Tree">
    <action>Move to West Most Tree</action>
    <action>Take Picture</action>
  </task>
  
  <task name="Return to Start">
    <action>Move back to the starting point</action>
  </task>
</mission>
```
This corrected XML file should work without any issues. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
