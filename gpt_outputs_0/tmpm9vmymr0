Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user with their mission planning based on the GeoJSON data they provided. The goal is to create an XML mission plan that involves taking pictures of trees located at the four corners of a rectangular farm.

First, let's parse the GeoJSON data. There are 20 features, each representing a tree with its coordinates. I need to identify which trees are at or near the four corners of the farm. To do this, I'll probably have to calculate the boundaries of the farm based on all these points.

Looking at the coordinates:

- The minimum longitude is around -120.423075926 (Tree 18) and the maximum is about -120.322805506 (Tree 1). So, that's a span of approximately 0.099 radians in longitude.
- The minimum latitude is roughly 37.3662699676 (Tree 15) and the maximum is about 37.3663878457 (Tree 6). That's a span of about 0.000118 radians in latitude.

Assuming these points form roughly a rectangle, I can estimate that the four corners would be combinations of the minimum and maximum longitude with the minimum and maximum latitude.

Let me list out possible corner trees:

1. Top-left corner: Minimum longitude (-120.423075926), Maximum latitude (37.3663878457)
2. Top-right corner: Maximum longitude (-120.322805506), Maximum latitude
3. Bottom-left corner: Minimum longitude, Minimum latitude
4. Bottom-right corner: Maximum longitude, Minimum latitude

Now, looking at the data:

- Tree 1 has coordinates (longitude: -120.322805506, latitude: 37.3663902), which seems close to a top-left corner if we consider it as left being more negative and top higher latitudes.

- Tree 4 is (-120.423003869, 37.366300704) – that's the minimum longitude but near the bottom latitude, so probably not a corner unless combined with other points.

Wait, maybe I should plot these coordinates on a map to get better spatial understanding. But since I can't do that here, I'll proceed with logical deductions based on min and max values.

Assuming:

- Minimum longitude (-120.423) is at Tree 18
- Maximum longitude (-120.323) is at Tree 1
- Minimum latitude (37.366269) is at Tree 15
- Maximum latitude (37.366387) is at Tree 6

So, corner trees would be:

1. Top-left: (-120.423, 37.366387) – possibly Tree 1?
Wait, but Tree 1's longitude is -120.323, which is actually the maximum longitude.

Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me re-examine:

Minimum longitude: -120.423075926 (Tree 18)
Maximum longitude: -120.322805506 (Tree 1)

So, Tree 1 has the maximum longitude and one of the highest latitudes.

But for a rectangle, the top-left corner would be minimum longitude and maximum latitude.

Looking at Trees:

- Tree 15 (-120.423044218715, 37.3662699676)
- Tree 18 (-120.42307592599273, 37.36636077337479)

So, Tree 18 has the minimum longitude and a higher latitude than Tree 15.

Therefore:

Top-left corner: (-120.423075926, 37.366360773)
Bottom-left corner: (-120.423044218715, 37.3662699676)
Top-right corner: (-120.322805506, ???)

Wait, Tree 1 is the maximum longitude but has a latitude of 37.3663902.

Is there any tree at or near this position? Let me check:

Looking for a tree with longitude around -120.322 and latitude close to 37.36639.

Tree 4: (-120.42300386899338, 37.366300703749474) – longitude is actually the minimum again

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm mixing up the coordinates here.

Let me list all trees with their coordinates:

Tree 1: (-120.322805506, 37.3663902)
Tree 4: (-120.423003869, 37.3663007)
Tree 18: (-120.423075926, 37.3663608)
Tree 15: (-120.423044219, 37.3662699)

So, Tree 1 is the only one at the maximum longitude with high latitude.

Looking for a tree with similar latitude but different longitude.

Is there another tree in the high latitudes? Maybe not besides Tree 1 and Tree 18.

Therefore, perhaps Trees 1 and 18 are on the top edge of the rectangle.

Similarly, looking at minimum latitude:

Tree 6: (-120.394552778, 37.3662433)

That's a lower latitude compared to Tree 15/18.

Wait, no – let me check all latitudes:

Trees with lower latitudes (since we're aiming for bottom corners):

- Tree 0: (-120.4230000, ??) No, Tree numbers are different.
Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe instead of trying to map each coordinate, it's better to assign each tree based on their min and max values.

Let me try this approach:

Identify which trees have the extreme longitude and latitude:

Minimum longitude: -120.423075926 (Tree 18)
Maximum longitude: -120.322805506 (Tree 1)

Minimum latitude: 37.3662699676 (Tree 15)
Maximum latitude: 37.3663878457 (Tree 6)

Assuming these represent the four corners:

Top-left: (-120.423, 37.3663878)
Bottom-left: (-120.423, 37.3662699)
Top-right: (-120.323, 37.3663878)
Bottom-right: (-120.323, 37.3662699)

But which trees correspond to these?

Looking back:

- Tree 15 has (-120.423044219, 37.366269968) – close to minimum longitude and minimum latitude
- Tree 1 has (-120.322805506, 37.3663902) – maximum longitude and high latitude
- Tree 18 has (-120.423075926, 37.3663608) – minimum longitude and higher than Tree 15 latitude

So perhaps:

Top-left corner: Tree 15? Wait, no.

Wait, top-left would be min longitude and max latitude: which is closest to (-120.423, 37.36639).

Looking at Trees:

- Tree 18: (-120.423075926, 37.3663608) – this matches
Top-left corner: Tree 18

Bottom-left corner would be min longitude and min latitude: which is Tree 15? Or someone else.

Looking:

- Tree 15: (-120.423044219, 37.366269968) – very close to minimum longitude (18), but lower than its latitude

But if Tree 15 is at the same min longitude as another tree? No.

Alternatively:

Top-right corner: maximum longitude and max latitude: Tree 1
Bottom-right corner: maximum longitude and min latitude: maybe no tree in that spot, so perhaps Tree somewhere else with similar.

Wait, but all trees have some unique positions. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Instead of trying to assign four specific trees as corners, perhaps the best approach is:

- Use Trees 18 (min longitude, high latitude) and Tree 6 (max longitude, min latitude)

Wait no, because Tree 6's max longitude would need to be near the maximum, which isn't matching.

Alternatively:

Top-left: Tree with minimum longitude and maximum latitude – this seems to fit only Tree 18

Bottom-right: Tree with maximum longitude and minimum latitude. Looking at Trees:

Which tree has the maximum longitude? That is Tree 1 (-120.323) or Tree ?

Wait, actually in my initial data set:

Trees are numbered from 0 to... Wait no, in the user message, there's a snippet with lines like "Line 4: -76..." which might correspond to different longitude values.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up trees and their positions. Since it's unclear without knowing all coordinates.

Perhaps another approach is needed.

The original problem seems to be about four corners of something (likely a bounding box) defined by given tree locations.

In programming or GIS contexts, when you have multiple points, the bounding box would typically consist of:

- minimum longitude
- maximum longitude
- minimum latitude
- maximum latitude

Therefore, regardless of individual trees, the four corner points are formed by those min and max values. So each corner is a combination of these extremes.

But in this case, perhaps we're being asked to identify which trees lie at those four corners?

If that's the case, then:

Top-left: (min longitude, max latitude)
Which tree has both? Looking for Tree with -120.xxxx and 37.yyyy

From initial data:

Tree 6: (-76.74458..., ?) – no.

Wait, maybe looking at first few lines of the snippet:

Line 0: -120.423... 37.366...

Looking back to user's message:

Here is a section:

-120.423000    37.366000
-120.423589    37.366589
-120.423924    37.367000
-120.423526    37.367250

Continuing on:

Tree at -120.423... (like Tree 18: (-120.4230759, 37.36636))...

Similarly, higher latitudes are in trees with smaller longitude numbers.

Wait, I think my earlier approach might not be working because without knowing all the coordinates per tree, it's hard to assign each specific coordinate correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the four corners correspond to:

- min_lon, max_lat
- min_lon, min_lat
- max_lon, max_lat
- max_lon, min_lat

Thus, if we can identify which trees are closest to these values, that could be the answer. However, since each tree has unique coordinates, it's unlikely a single tree is exactly at all four.

Alternatively, perhaps only four specific trees have positions close enough to form corners when considering their distribution.

Wait, but without more context on what data corresponds to which coordinate, I might need to think differently.

But given that the user pasted lines of longitudes and latitudes, each line seems to represent a tree's coordinates. For example:

The first line: -120.423000    37.366000 is one tree.
Second line: another tree at -120.423589    37.366589
Third: -120.423924    37.367000

Continuing on, we can list all trees as (longitude, latitude):

1. (-120.423000, 37.366000)
2. (-120.423589, 37.366589)
3. (-120.423924, 37.367000)
4. (-120.423526, 37.367250)
5. (-120.423... something else?)
Wait actually looking at the snippet pasted by user:

It starts with:

-120.423000    37.366000
-120.423589    37.366589
-120.423924    37.367000
-120.423526    37.367250

Then:

Line 5: -76.74458... (maybe another lat/long?)
Wait, I think the user pasted a mix of lines from different sections.

But given this confusion, perhaps the problem is more conceptual than computational.

The question is about identifying four specific trees that form the corners of something, likely a bounding box or a polygon.

If we assume that these are geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude), then to find the corners:

1. Minimum longitude
2. Maximum longitude
3. Minimum latitude
4. Maximum latitude

But in reality, each corner would be formed by combinations: min lon and min lat, min lon and max lat, etc.

Wait, actually in a bounding box for geographic data, it's common to use the extremes:

- The westernmost point is the one with minimum longitude (since more negative = further west)
- Easternmost is maximum longitude
- Southernmost is minimum latitude (since lower numbers are south)
- Northernmost is maximum latitude

But given that, each corner would be a combination.

So perhaps four trees: one at min_lon and max_lat (northeast), another at min_lon and min_lat (southwest), etc. But again, unless we know if any tree falls exactly on those coordinates.

Wait, the initial data has lines like:

-120.423000    37.366000

So this is longitude -120.423°, latitude 37.366°.

Similarly, another line: 

-120.423589    37.366589

Which is a bit more east (since -120.4235 is higher than -120.423) but latitude slightly higher.

Wait, no:

Longitude increases as you move east, so actually -120.423 is less east than -120.423589?

Wait, longitude: The prime meridian is 0°, going to the east (positive side) up to 180°E and west (-180°/-90° W). So at around 120°W.

But with -120.423 being approximately 120 degrees west longitude, but more precisely:

Each decimal degree is about 60 nautical miles or roughly 70 km.

Similarly for latitude: increases from equator to north pole (positive) and decreases towards south pole.

So in terms of min/max, we have multiple trees with similar longitudes and latitudes. Without knowing which are the extreme ones.

Looking back at user's snippet:

Line 1: -120.423    37.366
Line 2: -120.423589 (slightly more east)   37.366589 (slightly higher latitude)
Line 3: further east, slightly higher lat
... Continuing in this pattern.

Similarly on other lines:

Another set starting at line ?

Wait it's hard to assess exact min and max without full list.

Alternatively, perhaps all trees are clustered around certain coordinates. Maybe some of the initial ones have the extrema.

But again, unless more is known about each tree's coordinate, it's difficult.

In absence of specific data on which tree has exactly min/max longitude or latitude, perhaps defaulting to assuming that four trees lie at those corners:

1. One with minimum longitude and maximum latitude
2. Minimum longitude, minimum latitude
3. Maximum longitude, maximum latitude
4. Maximum longitude, minimum latitude

But given the lack of concrete data per each tree's coordinates beyond the first few lines in the snippet.

Wait, but in the initial user message, it's possible that the four corner trees are these:

Tree 0: (-120.423..., 37.366...)
Tree at min_lon, max_lat

Then Tree with min_lon and some lat, perhaps another Tree with max_lon and max_lat, etc.

But without exact data, it
