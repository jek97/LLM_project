 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected XML mission plan based on your task description:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <name>Tree Picture and CO2 Readings</name>
    <tasks>
        <task id="1">
            <name>Take a picture of 2 trees next to each other</name>
            <location>[INSERT LOCATION OF THE TREES]</location>
            <type>Camera</type>
        </task>
        <task id="2">
            <name>Take 2 CO2 readings of two trees next to each other</name>
            <location>[INSERT LOCATION OF THE TREES]</location>
            <type>CO2 Sensor</type>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</mission>
```
Please replace `[INSERT LOCATION OF THE TREES]` with the actual location of the trees you want to take a picture of and measure CO2 levels.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
