 Here's an example XML mission plan based on your instructions:
```php
<mission>
    <starting_point>
        <coordinates>-120.42307592599273, 37.36636077337479</coordinates>
    </starting_point>
    <tasks>
        <task id="1">
            <type>Picture</type>
            <target>-120.423044218715, 37.36626996761184</target>
        </task>
        <task id="2">
            <type>Temperature</type>
            <target>-120.423044218715, 37.36626996761184</target>
        </task>
    </tasks>
    <random_points>
        <point id="3">-120.423044218715, 37.36626996761184</point>
        <point id="4">-120.423044218715, 37.36626996761184</point>
        <point id="5">-120.423044218715, 37.36626996761184</point>
        <point id="6">-120.423044218715, 37.36626996761184</point>
        <point id="7">-120.423044218715, 37.36626996761184</point>
    </random_points>
</mission>
```
This XML file defines a mission with a starting point and two tasks: taking a picture of a tree and measuring the average temperature. The random\_points element lists five potential points for the robot to visit after completing the first task. Note that this is just an example, and you can modify it as needed to fit your specific requirements.
