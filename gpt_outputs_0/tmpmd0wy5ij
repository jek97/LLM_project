    <TaskDescription>
      This mission plan outlines a process for collecting environmental data at orchard trees. It begins with a picture capture and subsequent temperature and CO2 readings.  If initial readings are low, the mission will continue to drive to distant trees, repeating the data collection process. If initial readings are not low, the mission will proceed to the designated end point.
