This XML document includes a composite task that drives to two trees next to each other, takes a picture of one of the trees, and then takes two CO2 readings of one of the trees. After driving to another pair of trees, it takes another CO2 reading of one of the trees. The document also includes precondition and outcome states for each task in the composite task.

Note that this is just an example XML document based on your request, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific robotic mission plan requirements.
