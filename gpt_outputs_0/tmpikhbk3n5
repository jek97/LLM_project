Alright, I need to figure out why my XML mission plan is having this extra content issue again. It happened on line 23, column 1, which means it's showing up somewhere in the middle of the document now instead of at the end.

Maybe when I converted the GeoJSON data into XML earlier, some characters weren't escaped properly. That could be leaving behind unexpected text at this new position. Or perhaps there's an issue with how namespaces are declared – if one is missing or mismatched, it might be including extra content inadvertently.

I should check line 23 again to see what kind of data is there. Is it a special character that shouldn't be there? Maybe I can replace the entity reference used for things like `&nbsp;` with just a space directly in the XML. That way, if the parser doesn't recognize the entity, at least the space will make sense and prevent those extra characters.

Also, when dealing with namespaces, I need to ensure they're all properly declared. If one is missing or incorrectly spelled, it could be pulling in unexpected data from other parts of your schema or causing other issues downstream that lead to this extra content showing up.

I think the best approach now is to go back to where I'm converting GeoJSON into XML and make sure all special characters are being escaped correctly. Maybe using a different method for escaping or ensuring that all necessary namespaces are included without overlap might help fix this issue.

The XML mission plan contains an unexpected extra character at line 23, column 1, which likely originates from improper handling during data conversion or entity references.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Entity References Issue:**
   - The extra content may be due to improperly defined entity references in the XML schema that aren't properly recognized by the parser.

2. **Data Conversion Error:**
   - During the conversion of GeoJSON data into XML, special characters or symbols might not have been escaped correctly, leading to unexpected text appearing at the end of the document.

3. **Namespace Consistency Check:**
   - Ensure all namespaces used in the mission plan are properly declared and consistently applied throughout the document.

4. **XML Validation:**
   - Use XML validation tools like XMLLint or Schematron to check for schema mismatches after making changes, which might have introduced invalid content.

By addressing these points, you can resolve the issue of extra content appearing in your XML mission plan and ensure proper data conversion from GeoJSON sources.
