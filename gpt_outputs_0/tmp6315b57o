 Thank you for providing the details of your mission. Based on your instructions, I have created an XML file for your robotic mission plan. Please find below the XML code that represents your mission:
```php
<Mission>
    <Task name="Take a picture of the first tree">
        <Step name="Picture taken" status="Completed"/>
        <Step name="Take a CO2 sample" status="In Progress"/>
    </Task>
    <Task name="Measure another tree" condition="CO2 reading is low">
        <Step name="Picture taken" status="Completed"/>
        <Step name="Take a CO2 sample" status="In Progress"/>
        <Step name="Confirm CO2 reading by taking another CO2 sample" status="Not Started"/>
    </Task>
    <Task name="Continue driving to another tree and take another CO2 sample">
        <Step name="Picture taken" status="Completed"/>
        <Step name="Take a CO2 sample" status="In Progress"/>
    </Task>
    <Task name="Go to end">
        <Step name="CO2 reading is low" condition="CO2 reading is low">
            <Step name="Take another CO2 sample" status="Not Started"/>
        </Step>
        <Step name="End reached" status="Completed"/>
    </Task>
</Mission>
```
In this XML file, each task represents a step in your mission and is enclosed within `<Task>` tags. The tasks are executed sequentially, with some tasks having conditions that determine the next steps to be taken. Each step is represented by `<Step>` tags and has a name and status associated with it.

Please note that this XML file is just an example and can be modified according to your specific needs and requirements.
