 Sure! Based on your instructions, here's an example XML file for your mission plan:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <starting_point>
        <latitude>37.366294</latitude>
        <longitude>-120.4230530</longitude>
    </starting_point>
    <destination>
        <latitude>37.366294</latitude>
        <longitude>-120.4230530</longitude>
    </destination>
    <action type="take_picture">
        <description>Take a picture of the middle tree in the field.</description>
    </action>
    <condition>
        <type>average_temperature</type>
        <value>33</value>
    </condition>
    <destination>
        <latitude>37.366294</latitude>
        <longitude>-120.4230530</longitude>
    </destination>
    <action type="take_co2_sample">
        <description>Take a CO2 sample of the tree at the middle of the field.</description>
    </action>
    <random_destination>
        <latitude>37.366294</latitude>
        <longitude>-120.4230530</longitude>
    </random_destination>
    <distance>5</distance>
</mission>
```
In this XML file, the starting point is defined at the beginning along with the first destination and action (taking a picture of a tree). The condition for taking a CO2 sample is also specified. After that, the robot will move to another random point 5 trees down from the current location and perform the same action again.

Note that this XML file is just an example and can be modified to suit your specific requirements. You can add more destinations, actions, and conditions as needed.
