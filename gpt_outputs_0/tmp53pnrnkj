Okay, I understand. This error message indicates a problem with the XML structure, specifically an expected attribute value was missing on line 172.  This usually happens when I'm generating the XML and the structure isn't quite right.

To help me fix this, I need you to provide the following:

1.  **The Task Description:** Please paste the exact text of the `TaskDescription` element. This is the description of the robotic task you want me to create a mission plan for.  This is the input I need to understand what the robot should do.

2.  **The GeoJSON File:**  Please paste the content of the GeoJSON file. This file contains the spatial data (location, tree types, etc.) that I need to reference in the mission plan.

Once I have these two pieces of information, I will generate an XML mission plan conforming to the schema and incorporating the data from the GeoJSON file. I will also include a comment with the estimated total distance traveled.

Let's start with the Task Description. Please paste it here.
