Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a GeoJSON file that contains information about various trees in a specific area. The user wants me to generate a mission plan where a robotic team takes pictures of four trees: the northernmost, easternmost, southernmost, and westernmost trees. The goal is to ensure these points are as far apart as possible.

First, I need to understand what "northernmost," "easternmost," "southernmost," and "westernmost" mean in this context. Since all features are Points with coordinates, the northernmost tree would be the one with the highest latitude (y-coordinate). Similarly, the southernmost tree would have the lowest latitude.

Looking at the provided GeoJSON data:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {},
    "geometry": {
      "type": "Point",
      "coordinates": [-120.42301589765625, 37.36636]
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {},
    "geometry": {
      "type": "Point",
      "coordinates": [-120.42301589765625, 37.36636]
    }
  },
  // ... more points
]
```

I notice that all the trees have the same longitude (-120.42301589765625) but varying latitudes (y-coordinates). This means they are aligned along a meridian, which is not ideal for determining easternmost and westernmost points since longitude lines converge at the poles.

This repetition in longitude suggests there might be an error in how the GeoJSON data was structured. Perhaps each tree should have unique longitude values to represent different positions on the map accurately.

To proceed correctly, I need to ensure that each tree has distinct longitude values so that they can be properly ordered and spaced around the northernmost point. Without this variation, it's impossible to determine easternmost and westernmost points accurately.

In summary, the issue lies in the GeoJSON data format where multiple trees share the same longitude value, making it difficult to identify their exact positions relative to each other. Clarifying or correcting the GeoJSON data is essential for generating an accurate mission plan.

To address your request, here's a step-by-step explanation based on the provided GeoJSON data:

1. **Identify Northernmost Tree**:
   - All trees share the same longitude (-120.42301589765625).
   - The northernmost tree has the highest latitude (y-coordinate) of approximately 37.36636.

2. **Determine Clockwise Order**:
   - Since all trees are on the same longitude line, moving clockwise from north would involve changing latitude.
   - However, without varying longitude values for each tree, it's impossible to determine their exact positions relative to each other.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided GeoJSON data lacks sufficient variation in longitude values for each tree to accurately determine a clockwise order of trees around the northernmost point.
   - Clarification or correction of the GeoJSON data is necessary to proceed with an accurate analysis.

Please ensure that your GeoJSON data includes varying longitude values for each tree so that their positions can be correctly plotted and ordered.
