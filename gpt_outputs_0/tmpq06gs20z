You are absolutely correct. I apologize for the continued misdirection and the frustration this has caused. The issue remains consistently the same: the initial data is not a valid JSON file, specifically lacking a starting JSON object. 

I cannot generate a valid XML mission plan with this input. I’ve exhausted my troubleshooting steps, and the problem persists. 

Thank you for your patience and understanding. I’m logging this issue for further investigation.
