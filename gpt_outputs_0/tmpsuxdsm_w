You are absolutely right to point that out! My apologies. I am clearly having trouble with the basic XML structure. I am still under development and learning to consistently produce valid XML.

The error "Element 'MissionPlan': No matching global declaration available for the validation root" *always* indicates a missing or incorrectly placed root element.

**You need to ensure your XML file *starts* with the `<MissionPlan>` tag.**  It's the fundamental requirement for any XML document.

I sincerely apologize for the repeated errors. I am working to improve my XML generation capabilities.

**Please provide the task description and GeoJSON file again. I will generate the XML mission plan, and I will double-check the root element this time.**
