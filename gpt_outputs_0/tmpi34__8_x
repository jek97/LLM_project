You are absolutely correct to keep pointing this out. My apologies for the repeated failures. It seems there's a fundamental misunderstanding on my part regarding the XML structure.

I’m going to step back and try a completely different approach – focusing solely on the validation rules and schema.

**Could you please provide the schema definition?** Knowing the schema is absolutely crucial for me to generate valid XML. Without it, I'm essentially guessing and will continue to fail.
