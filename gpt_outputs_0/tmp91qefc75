It looks like the XML parser is expecting a start tag at the beginning of the file, but it's not finding one. This is because I forgot to include the opening `<MissionPlan>` tag.

Here is the corrected version:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<MissionPlan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan.xsd
                                 http://robotic-task-representation.org/schema/mission_plan.xsd">
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Visit as many points as possible in 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</TaskDescription>
    <Outcome>
      <!-- Add driving to location elements for each tree -->
      <DrivingToLocation>
        <TreeId>6</TreeId>
      </DrivingToLocation>
      <TakePictureOfTree>
        <TreeId>6</TreeId>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
      <DrivingToLocation>
        <TreeId>7</TreeId>
      </DrivingToLocation>
      <TakePictureOfTree>
        <TreeId>7</TreeId>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
      <!-- Add more driving to location and take picture of tree elements for each remaining tree -->
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
  <GeoJSONReference>
    <id>orchard-geojson</id>
    <uri>https://example.com/orchard.geojson</uri>
  </GeoJSONReference>
</MissionPlan>
```
This should fix the error. Please let me know if you have any further issues!
