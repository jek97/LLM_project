 I apologize for the confusion earlier. The error you mentioned suggests that there might be an issue with the formatting or encoding of your XML file.

Please ensure that your XML file is well-formed and correctly encoded (typically UTF-8). You can use a text editor to inspect the file and make sure that it starts with the correct XML declaration:
```scss
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```
In addition, you should also include an `xs:schema` element at the beginning of your XML file that references the schema definition, like this:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" targetNamespace="urn:robotics:missionPlan" xmlns="urn:robotics:missionPlan">
    <!-- your schema definition here -->
</xs:schema>
```
Make sure that you have included the correct namespace declarations and that all elements in your XML file are properly nested within their respective parent elements. You can use an XML parser or validator to check for errors in your XML file.
