Okay, this is a critical error. The `Start tag expected, '<' not found` message indicates a fundamental problem with the XML file's structure. It means the XML parser is encountering a character that isn't the beginning of an XML element (i.e., it's not `<`).

**This almost certainly means the file you provided is not valid XML.**

Here's what we need to do:

1. **Verify the File:**  Double-check the file itself.  Make sure it's a plain text file and that there are no hidden characters or formatting issues that might be interfering with the parser.  Sometimes copying and pasting from a word processor can introduce these problems.

2. **Re-create the XML:**  We need to rebuild the XML file from scratch, ensuring that *every* element starts with `<` and that all tags are properly nested and closed.

3. **Provide the Data Again:**  Once we have a valid XML file, please provide the Robotic Task Representation and the GeoJSON file again.

**I cannot proceed until the XML file is correctly formatted.**  I'm ready to help, but I need a properly constructed XML file as the foundation for the mission plan.

**To help you troubleshoot, here are some common causes of this error:**

*   **Incorrect Encoding:** The file might be saved with an encoding that the XML parser doesn't recognize (e.g., UTF-16 instead of UTF-8).  Try saving the file as UTF-8.
*   **Missing or Incorrectly Placed Tags:**  A tag might be missing, or a closing tag might be out of order.
*   **Hidden Characters:**  As mentioned before, copying and pasting can introduce invisible characters.

Let's start with a clean slate.  Can you re-create the XML file and provide the Robotic Task Representation and the GeoJSON file?  I'm here to guide you through the process.
