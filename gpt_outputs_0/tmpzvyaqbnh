It seems that I made an incorrect assumption about the XML schema.

Let's try a different approach. Here is a simple XML file with a GeoJSON reference:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<missionPlan>
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Drive to the middle of the field and take a picture of a tree.</TaskDescription>
    <DrivingLocation>
      <GPSLocation>
        <reference geojson="https://example.com/field.geojson"/>
      </GPSLocation>
    </DrivingLocation>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>

  <Outcome>
    <DrivingDistance>0 km</DrivingDistance>
    <ActionDescription>Take a picture of a tree.</ActionDescription>
    <Condition>
      <TemperatureThreshold>33 C</TemperatureThreshold>
    </Condition>
    <AdditionalActions>
      <TakeCO2Sample/>
    </AdditionalActions>
  </Outcome>

  <!-- Randomly select another point 5 trees down -->
  <RandomPointSelection>
    <TreeID>6</TreeID>
  </RandomPointSelection>
</missionPlan>
```
This XML file includes a `reference` element that points to a GeoJSON file. The GeoJSON file would contain the location of the field, and this reference is used in the `DrivingLocation` element.

Please note that you will need to replace the `https://example.com/field.geojson` URL with the actual URL of your GeoJSON file.

Also, please make sure that the GeoJSON file is in a format that can be understood by the XML parser. The GeoJSON file should contain the location data in a format such as:
```
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [ -120.42302289785604, 37.36635688574164 ]
      },
      "properties": {}
    }
  ]
}
```
This is just an example of a GeoJSON file that contains the location data for the field.

Please try this version and let me know if you're still having trouble.
