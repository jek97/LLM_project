It seems like the issue is still present.

Let's try a different approach. Since we need to include the GeoJSON file references in the XML mission plan, I'll provide an example that includes the necessary opening and closing tags for the XML elements, as well as placeholders for the GeoJSON data:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Mission>
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Start Mission</TaskDescription>
    <Outcome>
      <!--DrivingToTree location="Feature #0" /-->
      <DrivingToTree location="https://example.com/geojson/tree1.geojson"/>
      <TakePicture action="take_picture"/>
      <If condition="picture_quality == 'low'">
        <TemperatureReading/>
        <If condition="temperature_reading == 'low'">
          <CO2Sample/>
          <If condition="co2_sample == 'low'">
            <DrivingToFarAwayTree location="https://example.com/geojson/tree2.geojson"/>
            <RepeatProcess/>
          </If>
        </If>
      </If>
      <Else>
        <DrivingToEnd location="https://example.com/geojson/endPoint.geojson"/>
      </Else>
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</Mission>
```
This XML file includes placeholders for the GeoJSON data, which can be replaced with actual URLs or data.

Please try saving this file with an XML parser that supports the necessary tags and syntax. If you're still experiencing issues, please let me know and I'll be happy to help further!
