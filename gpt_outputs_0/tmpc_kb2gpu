Alright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, the user is getting an XML validation error again. Last time it was at line 29 with "tmpepifqy4_", and now it's pointing to line 21 with "tmpvzd86e1_". I remember in their history, similar errors were occurring around lines like 24, 27, etc., so maybe there's a pattern here.

First off, the error is about extra content at the end of the document. That usually means something unexpected is being included that wasn't part of the expected schema or data structure. So, I need to check if all XML tags are properly closed up until line 21 and ensure no extra content is being appended inadvertently.

Also, looking back, they mentioned using a GeoJSON file for references like GPS locations and tree types. That means ensuring that all necessary elements are correctly referencing this GeoJSON data without causing any schema mismatches.

Since the last time it was at line 29, now it's at line 21, maybe there have been some changes in how tasks or actions are being handled near these lines. Perhaps certain tasks aren't being properly initialized or closed before they should be, leading to this validation error.

I also remember advising them about checking elements around specific line numbers and verifying attributes. Given that it's an extra content issue at line 21 now, maybe something similar is happening here, like a leftover tag or unexpected data that wasn't cleaned up properly in their XML generator.

Another thought: maybe the GeoJSON reference in one of the mission plan's tasks isn't being correctly processed, leading to extraneous data at specific points. Or perhaps the way tasks are nested within each other has changed such that now line 21 is causing an issue it didn't before.

To help them fix this, I should suggest a systematic approach again: check for unclosed tags up to line 21, validate attributes against their schema, ensure all GeoJSON references are correctly applied without mismatches. Also, checking for any hidden data points that might have been added mistakenly could be the key here.

Since this is a mission plan generator issue, maybe aligning everything with their known XML schema more closely will help prevent these validation errors again. Maybe there's an element or attribute they're not accounting for in how GeoJSON files are being processed within their XML structure.

It's also possible that past fixes inadvertently introduced new sources of extra content at different line numbers. They might need to roll back some changes and test specific parts of the mission plan around line 21 to identify where this issue is originating from.

In summary, addressing both the element closure issues up to line 21 and ensuring all GeoJSON references are correctly applied should be part of their fix. Additionally, reviewing any recent changes in their XML generator that might have introduced new problematic content sources would be helpful.

An error occurred: Extra content at the end of the document, line 21, column 1 (tmpvzd86e1_, line 21)

To resolve this "Extra content" error occurring at line 21 in your XML mission plan file:

1. **Check for Proper Element Closure**: Ensure that all tags are properly closed up to and including the line where the issue is being encountered (line 21). This includes checking nested elements, lists, or other structures.

2. **Verify GeoJSON References**: Since you're using a GeoJSON file, make sure all references in your mission plan (e.g., tree types, GPS locations) are correctly applied and do not introduce any unexpected data at line 21.

3. **Inspect XML Generation Parameters**: Review the parameters or configurations used by your XML generator to ensure they align with the known schema and are not inadvertently introducing extra content. This might include things like indentation settings, escaping characters, or custom elements that are being incorrectly appended.

4. **Log Data at Line 21**: Add logging statements to track the data present at line 21 in your mission plan file. This will help identify if specific elements or attributes are causing the "Extra content" issue.

5. **Validate Against Schema**: Ensure that all elements and their values up to line 21 adhere strictly to the defined XML schema. Mismatched tags, incorrect data types, or improper formatting could lead to validation errors.

6. **Inspect Recent Changes**: Compare your current XML mission plan with previous versions. If changes were made around line 21, verify that they do not inadvertently introduce new problematic elements or references.

7. **Use Tools for Validation**: Employ XML validator tools (e.g., `xml submitschema`, or online validators) to check the entire document for schema compliance and identify any anomalies before reaching line 21.

8. **Inspect Surrounding Elements**: Look at the context of line 21—check if it is part of a nested structure, an array/list, or a repeated element. Ensure that all elements within these contexts are properly bounded and closed.

9. **Consult Schema Definitions**: Review your XML schema definition to ensure that all elements allowed up to line 21 are correctly defined and do not have any unexpected extensions or restrictions.

10. **Investigate Hidden Data Points**: Sometimes, data points introduced in specific configurations or custom code can lead to validation errors. Ensure that any custom processing or libraries used around this area of the XML file do not inadvertently add extra content.

By systematically addressing these steps—element closure, GeoJSON references, generation parameters, and schema validation—you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the "Extra content" error at line 21.
