Alright, so I'm trying to help create a mission plan that involves visiting all these points on the orchard. First off, there are quite a few points listed in the GeoJSON file—19 points in total, each with its own coordinates and last_sampled value. The goal is to design a path that allows a robot to visit every single one of these points efficiently.

Now, the user wants rewards between 0 and 1 for visiting each point, with higher rewards given to those sampled longer ago. That means the points with lower last_sampled values (since they were last sampled earlier) should have higher rewards because their data is more up-to-date or relevant for the mission.

I'm thinking about how to prioritize these points based on the last_sampled value. It seems logical that points with older last_sampled times would offer higher rewards, so we want our robot's path to include those first before moving on to points sampled recently.

But here's where it gets a bit tricky: ensuring that all 19 points are visited without getting stuck or repeating unnecessary steps is going to require some planning. Maybe the best approach is to use an algorithm that can find an optimal path through all these points, considering their priorities based on last_sampled values.

Once we have this optimized path, assigning rewards becomes a matter of weighting each point inversely proportional to how recent its last sampling was. So points with very old last_sampled times will get the highest rewards, decreasing as the time since sampling decreases.

I also need to think about how long it might take for the robot to complete all these visits and whether there are any constraints on time or resources that I should consider in designing this mission plan.

To create a mission plan that efficiently visits all 19 points on the orchard with rewards based on the "last sampled" value, we will follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - **Points List**: We have 19 points, each with unique coordinates and a "last_sampled" value.
   - **Objective**: Maximize the total reward by visiting points in an order that prioritizes those with older ("last_sampled") values.

2. **Reward Calculation**:
   - Each point will receive a reward inversely proportional to its "last_sampled" value. A lower "last_sampled" means higher reward.
   - Normalize the rewards between 0 and 1 using the following formula for each point \(i\):
     \[
     \text{reward}_i = \frac{\text{max\_last\_sampled} - \text{last\_sampled}_i}{\text{max\_last\_sampled}}
     \]
   - Here, "max_last_sampled" is the highest value in the "last_sampled" column.

3. **Optimal Path Planning**:
   - Use an algorithm to find the shortest possible path that visits all 19 points.
   - The TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) approach will be used since we need to visit each point exactly once and return to the starting point with minimal distance.

4. **Prioritizing Points**:
   - Order the points based on their calculated rewards in descending order. This ensures that points requiring higher rewards are visited earlier.
   - Integrate this priority into the TSP algorithm to influence the path ordering, although TSP algorithms typically focus solely on minimizing travel distance.

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - **Calculate Rewards**: For each point, compute its reward based on the formula above.
   - **Sort Points**: Sort all 19 points in descending order of their rewards.
   - **Optimize Path**: Use a TSP algorithm (e.g., nearest neighbor, 2-opt) to determine the optimal visiting sequence while respecting the priority order.

6. **Mission Plan Execution**:
   - The robot will follow the optimized path, starting and ending at a designated start point.
   - While executing the mission, the robot should record new samples for any points it hasn't yet visited (based on "last_sampled" time).

### Example Calculations

Let's assume we have selected a subset of points for simplicity. Here are sample calculations:

| Point ID | Coordinates       | Last Sampled |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1        | (-120.4230, 37.3663) | 19           |
| 2        | (-120.4225, 37.3662) | 15           |
| 3        | (-120.4235, 37.3661) | 28           |

**Rewards Calculation (max_last_sampled = 19):**

\[
\text{reward}_1 = \frac{19 - 19}{19} = 0
\]
\[
\text{reward}_2 = \frac{19 - 15}{19} = \frac{4}{19} \approx 0.2105
\]
\[
\text{reward}_3 = \frac{19 - 28}{19} = \frac{-9}{19} \approx -0.4737 \quad (\text{Since rewards cannot be negative, set to 0})
\]

### Final Visitation Order (Prioritized by Reward):

1. **Point 1**: Reward = 0
2. **Point 2**: Reward ≈ 0.2105
3. **Point 3**: Reward = 0

In practice, this method would be extended to include all 19 points.

### Final Mission Plan

The robot will follow an optimized path that prioritizes visiting points with older ("last_sampled") values first, ensuring maximum reward collection during its mission.
