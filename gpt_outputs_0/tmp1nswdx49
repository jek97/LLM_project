 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is a corrected version of the XML file:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<RoboticMissionPlan>
  <Location id="1">[123.456,789.012]</Location>
  <Task id="1">
    <Type>Take a picture of two trees next to each other</Type>
    <Action>Take a picture of the trees with the camera</Action>
  </Task>
  <Task id="2">
    <Type>Take CO2 readings of two trees next to each other</Type>
    <Action>Measure the CO2 levels with the sensors</Action>
  </Task>
  <Task id="3">
    <Type>Move to the next task location</Type>
    <Action>Navigate to the next location using the GPS system</Action>
  </Task>
  <!-- Add more tasks and locations as needed -->
</RoboticMissionPlan>
```
This XML file should work without any errors. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
