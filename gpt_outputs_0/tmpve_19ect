 Here is an example of a mission plan XML document that visits as many trees as possible within 100 meters and takes pictures of each tree:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <name>Tree Picture Mission</name>
    <description>Visit as many trees as possible within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</description>
    <start_point>
        <x>0.42307592599273</x>
        <y>0.36636077337479</y>
    </start_point>
    <end_point>
        <x>0.42307592599273</x>
        <y>0.36636077337479</y>
    </end_point>
    <tasks>
        <task id="1">
            <name>Visit Tree 1 and Take Picture</name>
            <description>Visit Tree 1 and take a picture of it.</description>
            <position>
                <x>0.42307592599273</x>
                <y>0.36636077337479</y>
            </position>
        </task>
        <!-- Add more tasks here -->
    </tasks>
</mission>
```
This XML file defines a mission with a name and description, as well as start and end points. The `<tasks>` element contains one or more `<task>` elements, each of which describes a specific task to be performed at a particular location. In this example, the first task is to visit Tree 1 and take a picture of it, with its position defined in the `<position>` element. You can add more tasks as needed, each with its own position and description.

Note that this XML file does not include any actual pictures or other data; it only defines the mission plan and the tasks to be performed. The actual pictures would need to be stored separately and referenced in the XML file if necessary.
