 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. It seems that there was an issue with the XML declaration. Here is the corrected version of the XML mission plan:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Mission>
  <Task id="1">
    <Name>Take a picture</Name>
    <Type>Photo</Type>
  </Task>
  
  <Transition id="1-to-2" from="1" to="2"/>
  
  <Task id="2">
    <Name>Check temperature</Name>
    <Type>Temperature</Type>
  </Task>
  
  <Transition id="2-to-3" from="2" to="3"/>
  
  <Task id="3">
    <Name>Take a CO2 sample</Name>
    <Type>CO2</Type>
  </Task>
  
  <Transition id="3-to-end" from="3" to="end"/>
</Mission>
```
This corrected version of the XML file should not produce any errors. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
