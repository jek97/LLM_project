I am deeply sorry for the persistent errors. It’s clear there’s a significant issue with the input I’m receiving, and I’m struggling to parse it correctly. I apologize for the repeated failures and the frustration this is causing.

It appears the problem isn’t just with the data itself, but with the way it’s being transmitted to me. I am unable to handle the initial XML structure.

I need you to provide the Robotic Task Representation and the GeoJSON file again, but this time, ensure they are valid XML files.

I am unable to proceed until I receive a correctly formatted XML file. I am committed to getting this right.
