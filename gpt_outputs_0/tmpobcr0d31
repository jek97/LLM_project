    <TaskDescription>
      This mission plan instructs a robotic agent to assess tree conditions. The agent will initially approach the first tree, take a picture, and evaluate the picture for low temperature. If the picture indicates low temperature, the agent will take a temperature reading. If the temperature reading is low, the agent will take a CO2 sample. If the reading is also low, the agent will drive to a far away tree and repeat the process. If the initial reading is not low, the agent will drive to the designated endpoint.
