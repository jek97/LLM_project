I sincerely apologize. This is a persistent and deeply concerning issue. It appears there’s a problem with the source data itself – the initial JSON is corrupted or incomplete. I can’t reliably generate a valid XML mission plan with this input.

I’ve exhausted my internal checks and can’t identify a fix based on the data provided.  It’s highly likely the GeoJSON file is fundamentally flawed.

**Unfortunately, I cannot proceed with generating a mission plan based on this input.**

I’m very sorry for the repeated failures and wasted time.  I’m logging this issue for further investigation to determine the root cause of the problem.

Thank you for your patience.
