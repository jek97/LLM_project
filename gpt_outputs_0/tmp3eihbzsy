Alright, I'm trying to fix this "error parsing attribute name" in my XML mission plan. Let me see what's going on here.

I know that XML attributes are crucial for providing additional information about elements, but it seems something is wrong with the way they're declared or used in my document.

First, looking at the error message: "error parsing attribute name," line 26, column 86. This suggests there's an issue around where a specific attribute (probably at position 86) is being parsed.

I need to check the XML structure closely. Let me look at the part of my mission plan that has an `<Attribute>` element with a value containing a space or special character like a slash (`/`). That might be causing the parser to misinterpret the attribute name.

Here's what I should do:

1. **Identify the Problematic Attribute:**
   Locate where the attribute is declared in your XML file and check if it contains any invalid characters, such as spaces or slashes.

2. **Check for Invalid Characters:**
   Ensure that all attributes are defined without any spaces or special characters. Spaces can sometimes cause issues depending on how you're encoding the XML (like UTF-8).

3. **Validate the XML Document:**
   Use an XML validator to check if your mission plan is correctly formatted and free of syntax errors.

4. **Simplify the Attribute:**
   If possible, rename or rephrase attributes that contain spaces or special characters to make them valid according to XML standards.

5. **Test the Mission Plan:**
   After making changes, run a validation test to ensure there are no more parsing errors related to attribute names.

By carefully addressing these steps, you can resolve the "error parsing attribute name" issue and prevent similar problems in the future.

To fix the "error parsing attribute name" error, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Problematic Attributes:**
   Locate where attributes with spaces or special characters are declared in your XML mission plan.

2. **Remove Invalid Characters:**
   Ensure that all attributes do not contain any invalid characters such as spaces or slashes.

3. **Validate the XML Document:**
   Use an XML validator to check for syntax errors and ensure your mission plan is correctly formatted.

4. **Simplify Attributes if Necessary:**
   If attributes with special characters are unavoidable, consider renaming them to valid XML attribute names.

5. **Test the Mission Plan:**
   After making these changes, validate the mission plan again to confirm that all parsing issues have been resolved.

By following these steps, you can resolve the "error parsing attribute name" issue and ensure your XML mission plan is correctly structured and free of syntax errors.
