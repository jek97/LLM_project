 I apologize for the confusion. The XML code provided earlier was incomplete and contained an error. Here is a corrected version of the mission plan in XML format with the provided GeoJSON file as reference:
```php
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Mission PUBLIC "-//example.com//DTD Mission 1.0//EN" "mission.dtd">
<Mission>
    <MissionHeader>
        <MissionID>1</MissionID>
        <MissionName>Tree Measurements and Temperature Reading</MissionName>
    </MissionHeader>
    <TaskList>
        <Task>
            <TaskID>1</TaskID>
            <TaskDescription>Find a tree somewhere in the middle of the orchard and measure cos.</TaskDescription>
            <Location ref="tree_in_middle"/>
        </Task>
        <Task>
            <TaskID>2</TaskID>
            <TaskDescription>If low reading, go to and take 2 pictures of nearby trees.</TaskDescription>
            <Location ref="nearby_trees"/>
        </Task>
        <Task>
            <TaskID>3</TaskID>
            <TaskDescription>Measure another tree as far away as possible for co2 and repeat the same process.</TaskDescription>
            <Location ref="far_away_tree"/>
        </Task>
        <Task>
            <TaskID>4</TaskID>
            <TaskDescription>Take a temperature reading at any one of the northern most trees.</TaskDescription>
            <Location ref="northern_most_tree"/>
        </Task>
        <Task>
            <TaskID>5</TaskID>
            <TaskDescription>Return to end.</TaskDescription>
        </Task>
    </TaskList>
</Mission>
```
Please note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust the code to fit your specific requirements. Also, I'm assuming that you have defined the `Location` element in the XML schema file (mission.dtd) with a reference attribute that points to the corresponding GeoJSON object.
