The error message you're seeing indicates that the XML file is missing a start tag. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as an empty or incomplete file, incorrect formatting, or a syntax error.
To resolve this issue, please ensure that your XML file starts with a valid start tag, such as `<MissionPlan>`. You can also try opening the file in a text editor and checking for any syntax errors or missing characters.
If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about the error message and any other relevant details so I can assist you further.
