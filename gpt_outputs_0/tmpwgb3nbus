 I apologize for the error in my previous response. Here is the corrected XML code:
```php
<mission>
  <task id="1">
    <name>Take a picture</name>
    <action>Take a picture of the tree</action>
    <condition>Low temperature detected in the picture</condition>
    <nextAction>Take a temperature reading</nextAction>
  </task>
  <task id="2">
    <name>Take a temperature reading</name>
    <action>Take a temperature reading of the tree</action>
    <condition>Low temperature detected in the picture and low temperature detected in the reading</condition>
    <nextAction>Take a CO2 sample</nextAction>
  </task>
  <task id="3">
    <name>Take a CO2 sample</name>
    <action>Take a CO2 sample of the tree</action>
    <condition>Low temperature detected in the picture and low temperature detected in the reading and low CO2 detected in the sample</condition>
    <nextAction>Drive to a far away tree</nextAction>
  </task>
  <task id="4">
    <name>End of mission</name>
    <action>End of mission</action>
    <condition>Low temperature detected in the picture and low temperature detected in the reading and low CO2 detected in the sample and not at a far away tree</condition>
  </task>
</mission>
```
This XML file defines four tasks, each with a name, an action to be performed, a condition that must be met for the task to be executed, and a next action to be taken if the condition is met. The first task is to take a picture of the tree. If the picture shows low temperature, the second task is executed, which involves taking a temperature reading of the tree. If both the picture and the reading show low temperatures, the third task is executed, which involves taking a CO2 sample of the tree. If all three conditions are met, the fourth task is executed, which ends the mission. If any of the conditions are not met, the mission will end at the current location.
