 I apologize for the error. It seems there might have been an issue with the XML file structure. Here is the corrected XML file with the required root element:
```php
<mission>
    <name>Orchard Exploration</name>
    <instructions>
        <step id="1">Take a picture of the northern most tree.</step>
        <step id="2">Drive to the middle of the orchard.</step>
        <step id="3">Take another picture.</step>
        <step id="4">Drive to the middle of the eastern end.</step>
        <step id="5">Take a picture of two trees next to each other.</step>
    </instructions>
</mission>
```
This XML file now includes the required `<mission>` element at the top, which serves as the root element. Please let me know if you have any further issues or need more help.
