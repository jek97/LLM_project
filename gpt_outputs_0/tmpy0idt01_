Okay, I understand. The error message indicates a problem with the XML structure, specifically an unexpected end of a tag within the `TaskDescription` element. This usually means there's an unclosed tag, a missing closing tag, or an incorrect nesting of tags.

To help me generate the correct XML mission plan, I need the following information:

1.  **The Robotic Task Representation:**  Please provide the data that defines the tasks the robot needs to perform. This should be in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV, or a similar format) that clearly outlines each task, including:
    *   Task ID
    *   Task Description (what the robot needs to do)
    *   Location (GPS coordinates - latitude, longitude)
    *   Object Type (e.g., "tree", "bench", "flowerbed", "sign")
    *   Action (e.g., "measure_height", "take_photo", "collect_sample")
    *   Priority (optional, to indicate task order)

2.  **The GeoJSON File:**  Please provide the GeoJSON file that contains the spatial data (e.g., tree locations, object locations, etc.).  This file will be referenced within the XML mission plan.

Once I have these two pieces of information, I will generate the XML mission plan according to the schema and incorporate the GeoJSON references.

**Example of the kind of data I need (as JSON):**

```json
[
  {
    "task_id": "T1",
    "task_description": "Drive to the large oak tree and measure its height.",
    "location": {
      "latitude": 34.0522,
      "longitude": -118.2437
    },
    "object_type": "tree",
    "action": "measure_height",
    "priority": 1
  },
  {
    "task_id": "T2",
    "task_description": "Drive to the bench near the flowerbed and take a photo.",
    "location": {
      "latitude": 34.0530,
      "longitude": -118.2440
    },
    "object_type": "bench",
    "action": "take_photo",
    "priority": 2
  }
]
```

**Example of the kind of GeoJSON I need:**

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-118.2437, 34.0522]
      },
      "properties": {
        "name": "Large Oak Tree",
        "tree_type": "oak"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-118.2440, 34.0530]
      },
      "properties": {
        "name": "Bench",
        "material": "wood"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Please provide me with the Robotic Task Representation and the GeoJSON file, and I will generate the XML mission plan.**
