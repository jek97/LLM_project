Alright, so the user is encountering another XML validation error in their mission planning XML file. The error message says there's an "invalid element name" on line 16, column 103 with the tag `tmp_zx756lz`. 

First off, it seems like they might have a typo or an undefined custom tag somewhere in their XML file that's causing the validation issue.

I should consider possible reasons for this error:

1. **Undefined Custom Tag**: They might have a custom element name (e.g., `tmp_zx756lz`) that isn't properly defined or declared in their XML file.
   
2. **Extra Characters or Data**: There could be extra characters, data, or content at the end of the document that doesn't conform to the expected schema.

3. **Whitespace Issues**: Sometimes, extra whitespace or comments at the end of the file can cause validation errors.

To resolve this issue:

1. **Check for Custom Tags**: If `tmp_zx756lz` is a custom tag, ensure it's properly defined with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration or within a DTD if they're using one.

2. **Validate XML Structure**: Ensure that all elements are properly closed and nested. Extra tags or content at the end of the file can cause validation issues.

3. **Inspect the End of the File**: Look for any extra characters, comments, or data beyond line 16, column 103. This could include trailing whitespace, comments, or unexpected data.

4. **Use XML Validation Tools**: Tools like `xml validators` or schema validators can help identify where the validation is failing. They can pinpoint if it's a custom tag, extra content, or other issues.

5. **Review GeoJSON References**: Since you're using GeoJSON references in your mission plan, ensure that all referenced elements are correctly formatted and within the expected structure.

If `tmp_zx756lz` isn't part of your intended XML structure, replacing it with a standard element name like `Tree` or `Location` would make sense if that's what you're trying to represent. Also, ensuring that all tags are properly closed and nested will help prevent similar issues in the future.

If you can provide more details about the specific XML file or the exact content causing the issue, I can offer a more tailored solution.
