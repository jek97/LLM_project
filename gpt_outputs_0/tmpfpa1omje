 Thank you for providing more information. It seems that there is an issue with the start tag of your XML file.

Please make sure that the first line of your XML file starts with a `<?xml` declaration followed by a closing bracket `?>`. Here's an example:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" targetNamespace="urn:robotics:missionPlan" xmlns="urn:robotics:missionPlan">
    <!-- your schema definition here -->
</xs:schema>
```
In addition, please make sure that you have closed all tags properly in your XML file. Check for any unclosed tags or missing `</tag>` endings in your file. If there are no issues with the formatting and encoding, could you provide me with more details about the error message so I can better understand the issue?
