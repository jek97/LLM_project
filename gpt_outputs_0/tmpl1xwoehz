 I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. It seems that there was still an issue with the XML file structure. Let me correct it once again:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <task name="Take a picture of the first tree">
        <action type="Camera">
            <picture></picture>
        </action>
        <condition>
            <reading type="CO2">
                <value low="10">Sample CO2</value>
            </reading>
            <reading type="Temperature">
                <value high="50">Take a temperature reading</value>
            </reading>
        </condition>
    </task>
    <task name="Measure another tree and take a picture if it's low, sample CO2 if that reading is low, sample CO2 again to confirm, then continue driving to another tree and take another CO2 sample."">
        <action type="Camera">
            <picture></picture>
        </action>
        <condition>
            <reading type="CO2">
                <value low="10" high="50">Sample CO2</value>
            </reading>
            <condition>
                <reading type="CO2">
                    <value low="10">Sample CO2 again to confirm</value>
                </reading>
            </condition>
        </condition>
    </task>
    <!-- Repeat the above task until the reading is no longer low -->
    <task name="Go to end">
        <action type="Drive" distance="50"/>
    </task>
</mission>
```
This XML file should work correctly. Please try again with this corrected structure. If you still encounter any issues, please let me know.
