Okay, so I'm trying to help someone fix an XML mission plan they're working on. The user mentioned a couple of errors now:

1. **Extra content at the end of the document** as before.
2. **StartTag: invalid element name**, which is pointing out that somewhere in their XML file, there's a tag with an invalid element name.

This time, it's specifically on line 6, column 91, and the temporary file being `tmp_huzb69g`.

First off, I need to understand what could be causing both of these issues. Starting with the first error: "Extra content at the end of the document." This suggests that there are unexpected characters or lines added mistakenly after the intended XML data ends.

The second error is about an invalid start tag—probably a `<` followed by a character that's not a valid XML element name, like a special character instead of a standard one. XML element names must be valid identifiers according to the schema they're using.

So, here's what I think might be happening: maybe the user has appended some extra text or characters at the end of their file, causing both issues. This could happen if an editor is open in another tab and accidentally adding content without realizing it. Alternatively, there might have been a copy-paste error where unintended lines were included.

To fix this:

1. **Check the XML File**: Open the XML mission plan file carefully to ensure that all tags are properly closed and formatted.
2. **Look for Extra Lines**: Pay attention to any extra characters or text at the end of the document, especially within temporary files like `tmp_huzb69g`.
3. **Validate the XML**: Use an XML validator to check for syntax errors after making adjustments.

Additionally, the invalid element name might be due to a mix-up with schemas if they're using different ones in the same file. Ensure that each section of your mission plan complies with the correct schema.

To address both issues:

1. **Check for Extra Content**: Open the XML mission plan and look carefully for any unintended text or characters at the end, especially within temporary files.

2. **Validate XML Structure**: After correcting any formatting mistakes, use an XML validator to ensure all tags are properly closed and that there are no syntax errors.

3. **Ensure Correct Schema Usage**: Verify that each section of your mission plan adheres to the correct schema if you're using multiple schemas in a single file.

By carefully reviewing and validating your XML mission plan, you can resolve both the extra content issue and the invalid element name error.
