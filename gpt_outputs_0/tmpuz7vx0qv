Okay, so I'm trying to help create a mission plan for visiting all the points on the farm based on the GeoJSON data provided. The user also wants rewards assigned to each point based on how long it's been since the last sample, with higher rewards for points sampled longer ago.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. It seems like we're dealing with some sort of robotic mission planning where a robot needs to visit multiple points on a farm. Each point has a location and a "last_sampled" value indicating how recently it was last visited or sampled. The reward for visiting each point should be higher if the point was last sampled further back, meaning it's more valuable or important to prioritize those.

So, I think the first step is to calculate the rewards for each point based on their "last_sampled" values. Since we want higher rewards for points with longer "last_sampled," maybe we can normalize these values so that they fall between 0 and 1. That way, it's easier to compare them across all points.

Looking at the data provided, I see there are 20 points (from id 1 to id 20). Each has a unique set of coordinates and varying "last_sampled" values ranging from 37 days up to 67 days. To calculate the reward for each point, we can use an exponential decay function based on the "last_sampled" value.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Reward} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k \times \text{last\_sampled}}} \]

- **k**: A scaling factor to adjust the steepness of the decay curve.
  - For simplicity, let's choose \( k = 0.2 \).

**Calculation:**
For each point with a "last_sampled" value, compute the reward using the formula.

\[ \text{Reward} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.2 \times \text{last\_sampled}}} \]

Once we have all the rewards calculated, we can normalize them to ensure they fall between 0 and 1 for easier comparison.

**Normalization:**
\[ \text{Normalized Reward} = \frac{\text{Reward}}{\max(\text{Rewards})} \]

This will scale all rewards so that the highest reward is 1, and the lowest is close to 0.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Calculate Rewards Using Exponential Decay Function:**
   - For each point, plug its "last_sampled" value into the formula:
     \[ \text{Reward} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.2 \times \text{last\_sampled}}} \]
   - This will give a reward between 0 and 1 based on how long it's been since the point was last sampled.

2. **Normalize Rewards:**
   - After calculating rewards for all points, find the maximum reward value.
   - Divide each individual reward by this maximum value to normalize them:
     \[ \text{Normalized Reward} = \frac{\text{Reward}}{\max(\text{Rewards})} \]
   - This ensures that all rewards are on a scale from 0 to 1, making it easier to compare and prioritize.

3. **Create Mission Plan:**
   - Once normalized, assign higher rewards to points that need priority.
   - Use an efficient pathfinding algorithm (like A*) to determine the optimal route that covers all points based on their priorities.
   - Ensure the mission plan includes tasks with corresponding rewards, order of tasks, and any necessary instructions.

### Example Calculation:

Let's compute the reward for a sample point:

- **last_sampled** = 40 days

Using \( k = 0.2 \):

\[ \text{Reward} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.2 \times 40}} \]
\[ \text{Reward} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-8}} \]
\[ \text{Reward} \approx \frac{1}{1 + 0.000335} \]
\[ \text{Reward} \approx 0.99967 \]

Normalize this reward by dividing by the maximum reward among all points.

### Conclusion:

By following these steps, you can create a mission plan that effectively prioritizes important points based on their last sampling value, ensuring the robot's tasks are both efficient and prioritized. This approach uses an exponential decay function to assign rewards and normalization to make comparisons easier.

To address the problem of creating a mission plan for visiting all points on the farm based on the provided GeoJSON data and assigning rewards appropriately, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Calculate Rewards Using Exponential Decay Function:**
   - For each point with its "last_sampled" value, compute the reward using the formula:
     \[ \text{Reward} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.2 \times \text{last\_sampled}}} \]
   - This function assigns higher rewards to points that were last sampled longer ago.

2. **Normalize Rewards:**
   - After calculating all individual rewards, determine the maximum reward value.
   - Normalize each reward by dividing it by this maximum value:
     \[ \text{Normalized Reward} = \frac{\text{Reward}}{\max(\text{Rewards})} \]
   - This ensures that all rewards are on a scale from 0 to 1, facilitating easier comparison and prioritization.

3. **Create Mission Plan:**
   - Prioritize visiting points with higher normalized rewards first.
   - Utilize an efficient pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) to determine the optimal route covering all points based on their priorities.
   - Structure the mission plan to include tasks, corresponding rewards, and the order of execution.

### Example Calculation:

For a point with "last_sampled" = 40 days:
\[ \text{Reward} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.2 \times 40}} \]
\[ \text{Reward} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-8}} \]
\[ \text{Reward} \approx \frac{1}{1 + 0.000335} \]
\[ \text{Reward} \approx 0.99967 \]

Normalize this reward by dividing it by the maximum reward among all points.

### Conclusion:

By following these steps, we can create an efficient mission plan that prioritizes farm points based on their last sampling value. This approach ensures tasks are assigned rewards and executed in an optimal order, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
