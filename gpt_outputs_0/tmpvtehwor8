Alright, I'm trying to fix this "error occurred: Extra content at the end of the document" in my XML mission plan. Let me see what's going on here.

I know that XML documents must have a well-defined structure with matching opening and closing tags. The error suggests there might be extra or unexpected content after line 31, which is close to the end of the file.

First, I'll check if all my elements are properly closed before the document ends. Maybe there's an element or attribute that wasn't closed correctly towards the end of the mission plan.

I'll look at line 31 and see what kind of content might be causing this issue. Perhaps there's a leftover comment, extra text, or an unclosed tag that's not supposed to be there.

To fix this:

1. **Review the Entire Document:**
   Go through your entire XML mission plan from start to finish to ensure every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag and nothing is left hanging at the end.

2. **Check for Trailing Characters:**
   Look for any extra spaces, characters, or comments that might be appended after line 31 without being part of the intended structure.

3. **Validate with an XML Editor:**
   Use an online XML validator or editor to check if there are any trailing content issues at the end of your document.

4. **Inspect Line 31 and Beyond:**
   Focus specifically on lines around 31 to see if there's anything unexpected that shouldn't be there, like extra attributes or tags.

5. **Ensure Proper Closure:**
   Make sure all elements are closed in the correct order before reaching line 31 so nothing is left open at the end of the file.

By carefully reviewing these aspects, you can identify and eliminate any extra content causing issues at the end of your XML mission plan.
