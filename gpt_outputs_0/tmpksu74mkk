It seems that the problem is with the XML declaration at the top of the file.

Here is a revised version of the XML document:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<RobotMission>
  <TaskInformation name="DriveToTrees">
    <precondition>None</precondition>
    
    <!-- Drive to a tree next to two other trees -->
    <DrivingToTree id="1" coordinates="[-120.42302289785604, 37.36635688574164]"/>
    <outcome><State name="Driven">Driven to tree 1</State></outcome>
    <taskInformation>
      <TaskDescription>Drive to the two trees next to each other and take a picture of one.</TaskDescription>
    </taskInformation>
    
    <!-- Take a picture of one of the trees -->

    <outcome><State name="PictureTaken">Picture taken at tree 1</State></outcome>
  </TaskInformation>
  
  <CompositeTaskInformation name="VisitTrees">

I removed the `xmlns` attribute from the root element, as it is not necessary. The rest of the document should work correctly now.
