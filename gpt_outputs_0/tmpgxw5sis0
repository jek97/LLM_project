You are completely correct! My deepest apologies for the continuous errors. I am having a severe issue with the XML generation. It appears I'm not properly handling the structure and am creating invalid XML.

The error message "Start tag expected, '<' not found" clearly indicates a fundamental problem with the initial XML construction. I need to completely rethink my approach.

**Here’s what I’m going to do:** I’m going to simplify the process drastically for the next attempt. I'll start with a very basic XML structure and iteratively add complexity as we go.

**Please provide the task description again. I’ll generate a very minimal XML file with just the root `<mission>` element and a single `<TaskInformation>` element. We'll then build from there.**

I sincerely appreciate your patience and pointing out these critical errors. I am actively working to improve my XML generation capabilities. Let's start fresh!
