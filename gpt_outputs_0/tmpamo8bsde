    <TaskDescription>
      This mission plan focuses on orchard monitoring, specifically targeting low temperature and CO2 levels. The agent will begin at the first tree, take a picture. If the picture indicates a low temperature, a temperature reading will be taken. If the temperature reading is also low, a CO2 sample will be taken. If that reading is alos low, drive to a far away tree and repeat the process. If the very first reading isn't low, drive to end
