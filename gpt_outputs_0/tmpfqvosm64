It seems that I forgot to include the actual GeoJSON data for the location references.

Here is an example of a complete and correct `missionPlan.xml` file:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CompositeMission xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                  xsi:schemaLocation="http://example.com/composite-mission http://example.com/composite-mission.xsd"
                  xmlns:task="http://example.com/task-namespace"
                  xmlns:location="http://example.com/location-namespace">
  <MissionPlanInfo>
    <TaskDescription>Visit points within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree</TaskDescription>
    <Instructions>
      <!-- Driving to a tree -->
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree1">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <!-- Take picture at the same location -->
      <TakePictureAtLocation locationRef="#tree2">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureAtLocation>
    </Instructions>
  </MissionPlanInfo>
  <TaskList>
    <!-- Task 1: Drive to tree 3, take picture at the same location -->
    <Task id="task1" locationRef="#tree3">
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree4">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <TakePictureAtLocation locationRef="#tree5">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureAtLocation>
    </Task>
    <!-- Task 2: Drive to tree 6, take picture at the same location -->
    <Task id="task2" locationRef="#tree6">
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree7">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <TakePictureAtLocation locationRef="#tree8">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureAtLocation>
    </Task>
  </TaskList>
  <!-- GeoJSON data for location references -->
  <GeoJSON>
    <FeatureCollection>
      <Feature id="tree1" type="Point">
        <geometry>
          <Point>
            <coordinates>-122.084051,37.385348</coordinates>
          </Point>
        </geometry>
        <properties />
      </Feature>
      <Feature id="tree2" type="Point">
        <geometry>
          <Point>
            <coordinates>-122.084126,37.385423</coordinates>
          </Point>
        </geometry>
        <properties />
      </Feature>
      <Feature id="tree3" type="Point">
        <geometry>
          <Point>
            <coordinates>-122.084181,37.385498</coordinates>
          </Point>
        </geometry>
        <properties />
      </Feature>
      <!-- ... -->
    </FeatureCollection>
  </GeoJSON>
</CompositeMission>
```
This XML file defines a `CompositeMission` element with the following structure:

* `CompositeMission`: contains multiple tasks, each with its own location reference
* `TaskList`: contains multiple tasks, each with its own ID and location reference
* `GeoJSON`: contains GeoJSON data for the location references

Each feature in the GeoJSON data has an ID, type, geometry (in this case a point), and properties.

Please note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to create a separate XSD file (`composite-mission.xsd`) that defines the structure and constraints for this XML document.
