It seems that I forgot to include the schema location for the `MissionPlan` element.

Here is the corrected version:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<missionPlan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://example.com/mission-plan http://example.com/mission-plan.xsd"
             xmlns:task="http://example.com/task-namespace"
             xmlns:location="http://example.com/location-namespace">
  <MissionPlanInfo>
    <TaskDescription>Visit points within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree</TaskDescription>
    <Instructions>
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree1">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <TakePictureOfTree locationRef="#tree2">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
    </Instructions>
  </MissionPlanInfo>
  <TaskList>
    <Task id="1" locationRef="#tree3">
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree4">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <TakePictureOfTree locationRef="#tree5">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
    </Task>
    <Task id="2" locationRef="#tree6">
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree7">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <TakePictureOfTree locationRef="#tree8">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureOfTree>
    </Task>
  </TaskList>
</missionPlan>
```
I added the schema location for the `MissionPlan` element, which points to a separate XSD file that defines the structure and constraints for the XML document.

I also updated the namespace declarations to include the `task` and `location` namespaces. These namespaces are used to reference specific elements within the XML document.

Please replace the fictional namespace with your actual namespace.

Additionally, please ensure that you have created a separate XSD file (`missionPlan.xsd`) that defines the structure and constraints for the XML document. This XSD file should include the schema location and namespace declarations mentioned above.
