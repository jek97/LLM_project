 I apologize for that error. It seems that the XML file does not conform to a known schema, which is required for validation. To resolve this issue, I will need more information about the specific schema you are using and how it relates to your mission plan.

Please provide me with the name of the schema, along with its location or link, so that I can create an XML file that conforms to it. Once I have that information, I'll be able to assist you in generating the correct XML file for your robotic mission plan.
