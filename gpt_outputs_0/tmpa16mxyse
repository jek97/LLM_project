Here is an example of the XML mission plan:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Mission xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="urn:robust-mission-planning-namespace v1.0
         http://www.example.com/robust-mission-planning-namespace/v1.0/mission.xsd">
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Start Mission</TaskDescription>
    <Outcome>
      <DrivingToTree location="Feature #0" />
      <TakePicture action="take_picture" />
      <If condition="picture_quality == 'low'">
        <TemperatureReading />
        <If condition="temperature_reading == 'low'">
          <CO2Sample />
          <If condition="co2_sample == 'low'">
            <DrivingToFarAwayTree location="Feature #10" />
            <RepeatProcess />
          </If>
        </If>
      </If>
      <Else>
        <DrivingToEnd location="EndPoint" />
      </If>
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</Mission>
```
Note that I've used the following elements and attributes:

* `Feature #0` is a reference to the first tree in the GeoJSON file.
* `location` attribute specifies the location of the driving task.
* `take_picture` action is performed at the first tree.
* `picture_quality` condition checks if the picture quality is low.
* `temperature_reading` condition checks if the temperature reading is low.
* `co2_sample` condition checks if the CO2 sample is low.
* `DrivingToTree`, `TakePicture`, `TemperatureReading`, `CO2Sample`, and `DrivingToFarAwayTree` are custom task elements that represent the respective actions.
* `RepeatProcess` is a composite task that repeats the process at a far-away tree.
* `EndPoint` is the final location of the mission.

Please note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements.
