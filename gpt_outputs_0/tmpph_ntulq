You are absolutely right! My apologies. I am having trouble parsing the input and generating the XML correctly. The error message clearly indicates a missing opening tag. This suggests the input I’m receiving is not properly formatted XML to begin with.

I need the data to be in a valid XML format.  I cannot proceed with generating the XML if the initial input is not correctly structured.

**Please provide the Robotic Task Representation and the GeoJSON file again, but this time, ensure they are valid XML files.**

To help you, here's a reminder of the expected format:

*   **Robotic Task Representation:**  This should be a well-formed XML document.  I'll need the `<tasks>` element to contain the individual task definitions.
*   **GeoJSON File:**  This should also be a valid XML file containing the geographic data.

I am ready to help once you provide the correctly formatted data.  I will double-check the structure and ensure it's valid XML before generating the mission plan.  Thank you for pointing out my error!
