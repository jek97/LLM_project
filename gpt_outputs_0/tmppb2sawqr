Okay, so I'm trying to help someone fix an XML mission plan they're working on. The user mentioned a couple of errors now:

1. **Extra content at the end of the document** as before.
2. **StartTag: invalid element name**, specifically on line 11, column 61, with the temporary file being `tmpvgwcjd6j`.

This time, it's more specific about where exactly the error is occurring—line 11 and column 61.

First off, I need to understand what could be causing this. The previous errors were general ("Extra content at the end of the document" and "invalid element name"), but now there's a specific location mentioned: line 11, column 61 in `tmpvgwcjd6j`.

So, focusing on this more detailed error:

**StartTag: invalid element name**

This suggests that somewhere in their XML file, at position line 11, column 61, the XML parser encountered a `<` character followed by an invalid element name. XML element names must be valid according to the schema they're using. So, this could mean one or more of the following:

- The tag at this location is malformed; perhaps it's not following proper XML syntax.
- There might have been a copy-paste error where incorrect tags were included inadvertently.
- Maybe there's an indentation issue that messed up the formatting and caused unexpected characters to appear.

Given that it's specifying both line 11 and column 61, this indicates that the error is precisely at that location in the file. So, my first step would be to locate exactly where that tag is.

To fix this:

1. **Locate the Error**: Open the XML mission plan file and find line 11, column 61, which corresponds to `<tagname>` where `tagname` is invalid.
2. **Check Tag Validity**: Ensure that all tags in your XML file are valid according to the schema they're using.
3. **Look for Copy-Paste Errors**: Check if any part of the mission plan was copied and pasted incorrectly, which might have introduced malformed tags.
4. **Validate XML Structure**: After making adjustments, use an XML validator to check for syntax errors.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that each section of your mission plan adheres strictly to its intended schema to prevent such errors from occurring in the future.

By carefully reviewing and validating your XML mission plan, you can resolve this issue. If there were copy-paste errors or formatting issues, correcting them should fix the invalid start tag error.

To address the "StartTag: invalid element name" error at line 11, column 61:

1. **Locate the Error**: Open the XML mission plan and locate exactly where `<invalid_elementname>` is present at line 11, column 61.

2. **Check Tag Validity**: Ensure that all tags in your XML file are valid according to the schema they're using. For example, if you're using an OGC SRS (Simple Resource System) schema for mission planning, make sure none of the tags have been incorrectly altered or added.

3. **Look for Copy-Paste Errors**: Check if any part of the mission plan was copied and pasted incorrectly, which might have introduced malformed tags into the XML file.

4. **Validate XML Structure**: After correcting any issues found in steps 1-3, use an XML validator to check for syntax errors throughout your entire XML mission plan document. This will help catch other potential issues that might exist due to improper formatting or schema usage.

By carefully reviewing and validating your XML mission plan, you can resolve the invalid start tag error and ensure compliance with the specified schemas. Correcting any malformations in the mission plan should fix this specific issue.
