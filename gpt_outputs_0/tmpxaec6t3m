Alright, so the user is encountering another XML validation error in their mission planning XML file. The error message says there's "extra content" at the end of the document on line 31, column 1 with the tag `tmpzaqq9s0p`. 

This suggests that there are unexpected characters or data beyond where they expect the XML to end. This could be due to:

1. **Trailing Characters**: Extra characters added after the expected end of the document.
2. **Comment Tags**: Unintended comment tags like `<!--` or `/*` at the end of the file.
3. **Whitespace Issues**: Trailing whitespace that wasn't removed.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check for Trailing Characters**: Look beyond line 31 to see if there are any extra characters or data appended to your XML file.

2. **Inspect Comment Tags**: Ensure there are no comment tags (`<!--` or `/*`) at the end of the document that aren't intended.

3. **Trim Whitespace**: Remove any trailing whitespace from the file, as this can sometimes cause validation issues.

4. **Validate with Tools**: Use XML validators like `xml validators` to check for any unexpected content beyond line 31.

5. **Review GeoJSON References**: Ensure all referenced elements in your GeoJSON are correctly formatted and within the expected schema boundaries.

If you provide more details about your XML file or share it, I can offer a more specific solution to fix this issue.
