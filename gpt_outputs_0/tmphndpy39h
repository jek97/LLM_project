 Below is an example of a simplified XML file structure that follows the schema and visits as many trees as possible within 100 meters. You may want to add more details depending on your requirements.
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <target id="1">[120.42298051393493, 37.36628908556382]</target>
    <target id="2">[120.42299259529793, 37.36635678715399]</target>
    <!-- ... more targets -->
    <robot>
        <position x="0" y="0" heading="0"/>
        <capability name="photography"/>
    </robot>
    <distance_threshold value="100"/>
    <movementStrategy type="sequential">
        <!-- ... your movement strategy -->
    </movementStrategy>
</mission>
```
In this example, the mission has 2 targets (id=1 and id=2) with their respective coordinates. You can add more `<target>` elements to include additional trees in the mission. The robot is equipped with a capability for photography. The movement strategy is set to sequential, which means the robot will visit each target in sequence. You can modify this strategy based on your requirements.

Please note that this is just a starting point and you may need to adapt or expand upon it depending on the specifics of your robotic mission.
