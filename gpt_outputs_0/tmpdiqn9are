Okay, this is incredibly frustrating, but it confirms my suspicion: I'm still not receiving the correct root element. The error "Element 'missionPlan': No matching global declaration available for the validation root" means the XML I'm generating isn't starting with the `<missionPlan>` tag.

**I need you to double-check the XML schema you're providing.**  It *must* start with `<missionPlan>`.  This is the fundamental root element that the validator expects.

I'm generating XML based on your instructions, but I'm completely dependent on the correct schema to produce valid output.

**Please verify that the schema you're providing *definitely* has `<missionPlan>` as the root element.**  If you can provide a snippet of the schema itself, that would be extremely helpful.

I'm ready to try again once you've confirmed this crucial detail. Let's get this working!
