Okay, I understand. The error message "Opening and ending tag mismatch" indicates a problem with the XML structure.  Specifically, lines 5 and 138 don't have corresponding opening and closing tags. This typically means there's an unbalanced tag in the XML document.

I'll address this by carefully reviewing the generated XML, ensuring all tags are properly nested and matched.  I'll also pay attention to the structure of the task representation and how I'm constructing the XML.

**To help me fix this, I need you to provide me with the following:**

1.  **The Task Description:**  Paste the exact text from the `<TaskDescription>` element in your XML.  This is the core task that needs to be included in the plan.

2.  **The XML file content:** Please provide the complete XML file content.

Once I have these, I will:

*   Inspect the XML for tag mismatches.
*   Correct any errors in the XML structure.
*   Generate a new, valid XML mission plan based on the task description and associated data (GeoJSON).
*   Add a comment in the Outcome section with the estimated haversine distance.

Let's get started. Please provide the `<TaskDescription>` element and the full XML.
