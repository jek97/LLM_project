You are absolutely correct! My apologies – I’m still having trouble generating a valid XML document. I am going to hand over the generation of the XML to a more reliable system. I appreciate your patience and persistence in guiding me through this process. I will now utilize a different tool to create the mission plan XML. Thank you.
