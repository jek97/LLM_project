Alright, so I'm getting this XML validation error that says "Extra content at the end of the document" on line 25. Hmm, what does that mean? Well, from what I understand about XML files, every opening tag needs to have a matching closing tag in the correct order for everything to work properly.

So if there's extra content at the end, maybe something isn't getting closed correctly before line 25. Maybe there are some unexpected characters or tags after that last element. I should check the XML file up to line 25 and see if anything is amiss with the closing tags. If there's leftover text or an extra tag, that could be causing this issue.

Another possibility is that there might be some trailing whitespace or comments at the very end of the document after line 25. Sometimes when you write XML files manually, it's easy to accidentally add a space or two before closing out, which the validator picks up as extra content. I should probably clean that up by trimming any whitespace or comments.

Also, could there be an issue with the way tags are nested? If elements are improperly nested, sometimes parsers get confused and might pick up unexpected characters while trying to match the right closing tag for each opening one.

To sum it up:
1. Check line 25 for any extra content that doesn't belong.
2. Ensure all XML tags before line 25 have been properly closed in the correct order.
3. Remove or trim any trailing whitespace, comments, or other unexpected characters at the end of the file.
4. Verify that there are no missing closing tags from previous elements that might be causing extra content to appear during validation.

By carefully reviewing these areas, I should be able to pinpoint and fix whatever is causing this error with my XML document.

The XML validation error "Extra content at the end of the document" on line 25 indicates an issue where there is unexpected content beyond what the document structure expects before the final closing tag. Here's a step-by-step explanation to address this issue:

1. **Understand the Error:**
   - The error occurs because XML validation finds additional text or characters after all expected elements and their tags have been properly closed.

2. **Check for Unmatched Tags:**
   - Examine the XML content up to line 25 to ensure every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag in the correct nesting order.
   - Look for any extra `<ns>` elements or other unexpected tags that haven't been properly nested and closed before line 25.

3. **Look for Trailing Characters:**
   - Check if there's any extra text, comments, or attributes appended after line 25 without being enclosed within an element.
   - Ensure that no trailing whitespace or comments are present immediately before the final `</ns>` tag.

4. **Validate the Document Structure:**
   - Use XML validators like W3Schools Validator or online tools to ensure your entire document doesn't have any unexpected content after line 25.

5. **Clean Up Any Manual Entries:**
   - If you've manually added any text, comments, or whitespace beyond what's part of an element, remove them immediately before the final closing tag.
   - This might involve trimming trailing spaces in your editor to ensure nothing is left behind that wasn't enclosed within tags.

6. **Check for Missing or Improperly Closed Tags:**
   - If you've used tools like `xz` or `zcat`, check if they mistakenly added content after line 25 without proper encapsulation.
   - Ensure no nested elements are unclosed before their closing tags appear at the right position.

By addressing these areas, especially focusing on ensuring all XML tags up to line 25 have been properly closed and that there's nothing extra appended beyond them, you can resolve this validation error. It's also advisable to manually inspect the file for any unintended additions or formatting issues immediately before the final closing tag.
