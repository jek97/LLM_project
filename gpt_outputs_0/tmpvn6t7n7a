 Based on your request, here is an example XML file that conforms to the known schema:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<robotMission xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <name>Tree Picture Mission</name>
    <description>Visit as many points as possible within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</description>
    <missions>
        <mission id="1" type="TakePicture">
            <targetId xsi:type="xsd:int">1</targetId>
            <imageCaptureSettings xsi:type="ImageCaptureSettingsType">
                <resolution>1024x768</resolution>
                <depthOfField>shallow</depthOfField>
                <focusMode>continuousAutoFocus</focusMode>
            </imageCaptureSettings>
        </mission>
        <!-- Repeat for other missions -->
    </missions>
</robotMission>
```
This XML file defines a single mission with the type "TakePicture" and specifies target ID 1. You would need to add additional `<mission>` elements to define more missions, as needed to visit all of the points in your specified area. The `<imageCaptureSettings>` element can be adjusted to suit your specific requirements for image capture settings.

Keep in mind that this is just an example and you may need to customize it further depending on your specific use case.
