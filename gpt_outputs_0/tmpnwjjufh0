The error message "Start tag expected, '<' not found, line 1, column 1" indicates that the XML file is missing a start tag. In an XML file, all content must be enclosed within tags. The first tag in an XML file should always be the root element.
To resolve this error, you will need to ensure that your XML file has a valid root element and that it is properly formatted. You can do this by checking the schema documentation for any required elements, attributes, and namespaces, and ensuring that they are all included in your XML file.
If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about the error message and the XML file so that I can assist you further.
