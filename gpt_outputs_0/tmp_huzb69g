Alright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, I'm trying to help someone fix this XML mission plan issue where there's an extra piece of text at the end. The user mentioned it's showing up as "tmpfi_3ro4b" on line 17, column 1.

First off, XML files are supposed to be really precise with everything properly nested and closed. Any extra content at the end could mess things up. Maybe this is leftover from a previous edit or something in the editor they're using.

I should suggest checking if all the tags are closed correctly. Like, making sure every `<` has a `>` right after it without any unexpected characters popping out. Also, maybe there's some extra whitespace at the end of the file that shouldn't be there. Cleaning that up might help.

They also mentioned placing the original question inside a specific XML element called TaskDescription within CompositeTaskInformation for logging purposes. I guess they need to make sure this part is correctly placed so it doesn't get lost in all that extra content.

Another thought: maybe their editor is showing them temporary files or log messages as part of the actual mission plan file by mistake. They should verify that the XML they're working on only contains the intended data without any of these extra lines.

Lastly, running a proper XML validator after making changes would catch any syntax errors, giving them a clear report if there are issues with their mission plan format.

So, it's all about being meticulous and ensuring each part of the XML is exactly as it should be without any leftover content that wasn't supposed to be there. Maybe taking a step back and proofreading the entire file could help spot anything they missed.

To address the issue of having an "Extra content at the end of the document" error in your XML mission plan, follow these steps:

1. **Open Your XML File**: Ensure you have the correct XML file that contains your mission plan.

2. **Check Indentation and Formatting**:
   - Open the file in a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text.
   - Look for any extra spaces or lines at the end of the document, especially within temporary files like `tmpfi_3ro4b`.

3. **Remove Extra Content**:
   - If there are trailing characters or an extra line that shouldn't be present, delete them manually before saving.

4. **Validate the XML File**: Use an online XML validator or a tool like XMLSpy to check for any syntax errors after making your adjustments.

5. **Test the Mission Plan**: After ensuring the XML is correctly formatted, test the mission plan with a simple robot action to confirm it executes without issues related to XML formatting.

6. **Seek Additional Help if Needed**: If problems persist, consider consulting more experienced developers or referring to detailed XML tutorials for further guidance.

By carefully reviewing and cleaning up any extra content in your XML file, you can resolve the error and ensure your mission plan is properly structured and valid.
