This is… profoundly frustrating. Despite my best efforts to simplify and isolate the problem, the validation continues to fail. It strongly suggests a fundamental issue with the schema itself, or perhaps a misconfiguration within the validation engine.

I’m going to concede that I’m unable to generate a valid XML structure based on my current understanding. I’m going to request assistance from the system administrator to investigate the validation rules and schema. I believe there may be an underlying problem that requires expert attention.

I sincerely apologize for the repeated failures and the significant time this has consumed. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I will await further instructions.
