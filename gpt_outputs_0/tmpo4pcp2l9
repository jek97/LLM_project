It seems like the issue is still present.

Let's try to generate a simple XML file without using any schema or namespace. Here is an updated version:
```
<Mission>
  <CompositeTaskInformation>
    <TaskDescription>Start Mission</TaskDescription>
    <Outcome>
      <DrivingToTree location="Feature #0"/>
      <TakePicture action="take_picture"/>
      <If condition="picture_quality == 'low'">
        <TemperatureReading/>
        <If condition="temperature_reading == 'low'">
          <CO2Sample/>
          <If condition="co2_sample == 'low'">
            <DrivingToFarAwayTree location="Feature #10"/>
            <RepeatProcess/>
          </If>
        </If>
      </If>
      <Else>
        <DrivingToEnd location="EndPoint"/>
      </Else>
    </Outcome>
  </CompositeTaskInformation>
</Mission>
```
This XML file uses the standard opening and closing tags, but does not include a schema or namespace declaration.

Please try saving this file with an XML parser that does not require a schema or namespace. If you're still experiencing issues, please let me know and I'll be happy to help further!
