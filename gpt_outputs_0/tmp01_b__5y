 Here is an example of a mission plan XML document that visits as many points as possible within 100 meters and takes pictures of each tree:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <name>Tree Picture Mission</name>
    <description>Visit as many points as possible within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree.</description>
    <start>
        <point id="1">
            <coordinates>-120.42307592599273,37.36636077337479</coordinates>
        </point>
    </start>
    <tasks>
        <task id="1">
            <type>Take Picture</type>
            <target>Tree</target>
            <distance>100</distance>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</mission>
```
In this example, the mission starts at point 1 with coordinates -120.42307592599273,37.36636077337479. The task is to take a picture of each tree within 100 meters of this starting point. The `<distance>` element specifies the maximum distance from the current position to consider for taking pictures.

Note that this XML file only contains a single task, but you can add more tasks by repeating the `<task>` element with different `<target>` and `<distance>` values.
