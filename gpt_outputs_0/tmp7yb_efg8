Okay, this is incredibly frustrating, and I sincerely apologize for the repeated errors and wasted time. It’s clear there’s a persistent issue with the input. 

I suspect the problem isn’t with *me* generating the XML, but with the source of the initial XML data I’m receiving.

**I need you to provide me with the *full* XML file content.**  I cannot proceed without a complete, valid XML document.

To help me diagnose the problem, could you describe *how* you are generating this XML?  For example:

*   Are you using a script or program to create the XML?
*   Can you paste the output of that script/program here?
*   What is the data source for the task information?

I need to understand where the problem lies in the data generation process.  Let's work together to figure this out.
