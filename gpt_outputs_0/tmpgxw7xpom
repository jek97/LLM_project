 I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there was an issue with the XML file format. Here is a corrected version of the XML file:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mission>
    <starting_point>
        <latitude>37.366289</latitude>
        <longitude>-120.42298051393493</longitude>
        <altitude>0</altitude>
    </starting_point>
    <mission_steps>
        <step>
            <action>Move to the middle of the field</action>
            <destination>
                <latitude>37.366289</latitude>
                <longitude>-120.42298051393493</longitude>
                <altitude>0</altitude>
            </destination>
        </step>
        <step>
            <action>Take a picture of a tree</action>
            <condition>
                <expression>Average temperature is below 33 C</expression>
            </condition>
        </step>
        <step>
            <action>Take a CO2 sample</action>
        </step>
        <step>
            <action>Move to another random point (5 trees down)</action>
            <destination>
                <expression>Randomly selected point within the field, at least 5 trees away from the starting point</expression>
            </destination>
        </step>
    </mission_steps>
</mission>
```
This corrected XML file should work as expected. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
