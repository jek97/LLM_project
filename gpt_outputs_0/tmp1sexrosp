    <TaskDescription>
      This mission plan instructs a robotic agent to assess tree health based on temperature and CO2 levels. The agent begins by taking a picture at the first tree. If the picture indicates a low temperature, a temperature reading is taken. If the temperature reading is low, a CO2 sample is taken. If the CO2 reading is also low, the agent drives to a distant tree and repeats the process. If the initial reading is not low, the agent drives to the designated end point.
