Alright, so I'm trying to figure out why there's an "extra content" error in my XML file. The error message says that there's extra content at the end of the document on line 15, column 1. Hmm, let me think about this.

First, I know that XML files need to be well-structured and conform to a specific schema or DTD (Document Type Definition). If something is wrong with the structure, the parser might flag errors. In this case, it's saying there's extra content at the end of the document. That probably means there's some text or data that wasn't supposed to be there.

Looking back at my XML file, I need to check if all elements are properly closed and nested. Maybe I have an element that isn't closed correctly, leaving some content hanging after it. For example, if I have a `<MissionPlan>` element but forget its closing `</MissionPlan>`, the parser might think there's extra data following it.

Another possibility is that there's trailing whitespace or comments at the end of the file that aren't part of any element. XML parsers are sensitive to this and might consider it invalid if it's not properly accounted for in the schema.

I should also check if I'm using the correct tags and attributes throughout the file. Maybe somewhere, an attribute is missing or mismatched, causing elements to be interpreted incorrectly.

To fix this error, I'll start by carefully reviewing my XML file from line 1 to line 15. I'll look for any unclosed tags or extra text that doesn't belong inside any element. If I find something like that, I'll remove it or adjust the structure so everything is properly nested and closed.

If I'm still unsure, maybe I can try validating the XML file using an online tool or a programming library to see where exactly the error is occurring. That way, I can pinpoint the issue more accurately.

To resolve the "Extra content at the end of the document" error in your XML file, follow these steps:

1. **Check Element Closure**: Ensure that all XML elements are properly closed and nested. If there's an unclosed element or a mismatched opening/closing tag, it might be causing extra content issues.

2. **Validate the XML Structure**: Use an XML validator to check for syntax errors. This will help identify any missing or extra tags, attributes, or text that shouldn't be present at the end of the document.

3. **Inspect Trailing Whitespace and Comments**: Remove any trailing whitespace or comments that are not part of a valid element. These can sometimes cause the parser to flag extra content.

4. **Review Attributes and Content**: Ensure all attributes are correctly specified and that there's no extraneous text following the last closing tag.

By addressing these points, you should be able to identify and remove any extra content causing the error, ensuring your XML file is well-structured and conforms to the schema requirements.
