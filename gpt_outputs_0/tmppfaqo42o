It seems that I forgot to include the actual XML structure for a `MissionPlan` element.

Here is an example of a complete and correct `missionPlan.xml` file:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<missionPlan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://example.com/mission-plan http://example.com/mission-plan.xsd"
             xmlns:task="http://example.com/task-namespace"
             xmlns:location="http://example.com/location-namespace">
  <MissionPlanInfo>
    <TaskDescription>Visit points within 100 meters and take pictures of each tree</TaskDescription>
    <Instructions>
      <!-- Driving to a tree -->
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree1">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <!-- Take picture at the same location -->
      <TakePictureAtLocation locationRef="#tree2">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureAtLocation>
    </Instructions>
  </MissionPlanInfo>
  <TaskList>
    <!-- Task 1: Drive to tree 3, take picture at the same location -->
    <Task id="1" locationRef="#tree3">
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree4">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <TakePictureAtLocation locationRef="#tree5">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureAtLocation>
    </Task>
    <!-- Task 2: Drive to tree 6, take picture at the same location -->
    <Task id="2" locationRef="#tree6">
      <DrivingToTree locationRef="#tree7">
        <Action>Drive to tree</Action>
      </DrivingToTree>
      <TakePictureAtLocation locationRef="#tree8">
        <Action>Take picture of tree</Action>
      </TakePictureAtLocation>
    </Task>
  </TaskList>
</missionPlan>
```
This XML file defines a `missionPlan` element with the following structure:

* `MissionPlanInfo`: contains the task description and instructions
* `TaskList`: contains multiple tasks, each with its own location reference

Each task has two child elements: `DrivingToTree` and `TakePictureAtLocation`. These elements have their own actions and location references.

Please note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to create a separate XSD file (`missionPlan.xsd`) that defines the structure and constraints for this XML document.
