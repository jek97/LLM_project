 I apologize for the confusion. Here is an example of a valid XML file that conforms to the known schema and uses the GeoJSON file provided by you:
```php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Mission xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <CompositeTaskInformation>
        <TaskDescription>Take a picture of 2 trees next to each other and then take 2 CO2 readings of two trees next to each other.</TaskDescription>
    </CompositeTaskInformation>
    <Tasks>
        <Task>
            <Type>DriveToLocation</Type>
            <Parameters>
                <Parameter name="Target" value="GeoJSON file provided by user"/>
            </Parameters>
        </Task>
        <Task>
            <Type>PictureTaking</Type>
            <Parameters>
                <Parameter name="Target" value="2 trees next to each other"/>
            </Parameters>
        </Task>
        <Task>
            <Type>CO2Reading</Type>
            <Parameters>
                <Parameter name="Target" value="2 trees next to each other"/>
            </Parameters>
        </Task>
    </Tasks>
</Mission>
```
Please note that the GeoJSON file provided by you is not included in this example. You will need to include it as a separate file and reference it in the `Target` parameter of the `DriveToLocation` task. Additionally, I have added a `DriveToLocation` task at the beginning of the mission plan to drive to the location where the pictures and CO2 readings are to be taken.
